Changes

Updates to Metadata Wizard:
--------------
1. Updated lxml library version and associated call (e.g., RestrictedElement removed)
2. Updated DOI certificate support
3. Update sciencebasepy library and associated code (was using sbpy)
4. Added inline comments and doc strings to almost every script.
5. Revised inline comments and code referencing http (instead of https; though these are usually redirected on most serviers) when not specified.
6. \pymdwizard\gui\spdom.py was not properly migrated to pyQT5, so modifications made to address QWebChannel, QWebEngineView, methods to run java script, and related steps.
7. Updated all library imports as they were included legacy support for python 2.7
8. Many scripts were importing libraries in functions, which made this software very difficult to manage (also not recommended). All of this was fixed.
9. Addressed issues with \pymdwizard\gui\spdom.py and centering, rendering of map on spatial tab.
10. Removed hardcoding of software version found in many scripts.
11. Updated older methods of string and variable formatting (.format() in 2.7) to F-strings, which is used in Python 3.
12. Updated all libraries for deployment and created a new yaml file. This should address vulnerabilities. This approach should be done every time work is done to the code (at least one release a year with new python bindings) and versions of all software should be current/acceptable.

TODO (Long-term): 
--------------
1. pyqt6 is not available on conda-forge (it is available on Anaconda), so not updating at this time.
2. There are a lot of bare except statements in code that should be addressed.
3. Add support for accessing data within ESRI FGDB (raster, feature classes/datasets) and geopackages (raster and vector).
----

TODO (Short-term): 
--------------
1. Check code with static analyzer
2. Address the commented out code in jupyterstarter.py. Need to test before cleaning up code.
3. MainWindow.py: Anaconda is not allowed. Revise line xxx.


FYI:
--------------
1. Running code from DOS prints STDOUT of:
  a. QPainter::begin: A paint device can only be painted by one painter at a time. (Seems to be a timing issue for splash, which I have improved and should not affect performance).
  b. js: Uncaught ReferenceError: xxx (Timing issue with splash screen and main app. This is a lot better now).
  c. QCssParser::parseColorValue: Specified color with alpha value but no alpha given: 'rgba 90, 90, 90' (I checked every html file, code, and other things but cannot seem to find where alpha is not included. I need change rgb to rgba, but this did not fix the issue (there is some CSS file somewhere that I am missing).
