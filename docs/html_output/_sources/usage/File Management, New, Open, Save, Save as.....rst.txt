File Management, New, Open, Save, Save as....
********

The Extensible Markup Language (XML) file format is the only currently supported format for metadata used by the Metadata Wizard 2.0. The XML format is one of the most commonly used formats for CSDGM metadata and is the format expected by many repositories and tools. By convention, the metadata file will be named identically to the data file it describes, with the addition of a .xml extension. For example data.csv would have an associated metadata file called data.csv.xml.

Within the Metadata Wizard 2.0 tool, XML files can be created, opened, saved, or saved as a new name using a dropdown file menu similar to many desktop applications. In the file browser window that pops up for these functions, only files with a .xml extension will be visible.

When first getting started making metadata click the File -> New option and navigate to a directory where you want to save metadata output. This will create a new .xml with the content contained in the default metadata template as well as the current date in the metadata date element. See `Changing-Your-Template`_ for more information about updating your template to streamline future metadata creation.

If you would like to modify or extend an existing record, click File -> Open and browse to a local .xml file. Make sure to click File -> Save asâ€¦ if you want to save the output as a new file.  You can also drag-and-drop an xml file onto the application from a file browser to open it.

A list of the last 10 files opened will be stored in the File -> Recent Files: menu item. Clicking on a file name in that menu list will open that record.

When closing the application or switching records, a users will be prompted to save their changes. It is good practice to save periodically when editing a record by clicking File -> Save.

--------------

File management in Metadata Wizard 2.0 is quite a bit different from the previous ESRI toolbox-based version.
