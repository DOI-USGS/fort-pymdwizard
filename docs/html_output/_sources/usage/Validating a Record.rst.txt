============================
Validating a Metadata Record
============================

To ensure metadata adheres to the FGDC standard, we can evaluate the syntax 
and the content. The Metadata Wizard handles the syntax validation, but the 
quality of the content requires an individual to validate accuracy of the content. 
Examples of items that can be flagged as syntax errors can include the following:

- missing content in required fields 
- incorrectly formatted items 
- values outside an acceptable range
- other violations

These errors can be identified directly in the tool by clicking **Run
Validation** in the Validation item on the menu bar. The record will be
validated and a message box will notify the user of the number of
errors found.

The items that are causing validation errors will be highlighted in red on the
Metadata Wizard.

A second window will display a list of all the errors found. Clicking on one of 
the errors will take the user to the tab/section that contains the error and outline it in 
black. Keep in mind that some errors might be hidden until the user scrolls up or 
down in the application, or selects the appropriate tab.

Potential Spelling errors within relevant text boxes will be highlighted in
red with a yellow background.

This functionality can be turned ON or OFF by clicking the Turn Spelling (ON | OFF)
item in the validation menu.
