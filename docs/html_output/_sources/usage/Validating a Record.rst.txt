Validating a Record
********

A first quality check of a metadata record is to make sure it adheres to
to the FGDC standard. Examples of items that can be flagged include:
missing content in required fields, formats that don’t make sense, or
values outside the acceptable range.

These errors can be identified directly in the tool by clicking ‘Run
Validation’ in the Validation item on the menu bar. The record will be
validated and a message box will pop up alerting you to the number of
errors found.

The item that’s causing the error will be highlighted in red on the
Metadata Wizard form.

There’s also a list of all the errors found in the ‘Errors:’ section of
the Validate item on the menu bar. Clicking on each of these will take
you to the tab/section that contains the error and outline it in black.

Keep in mind that to find some errors you might need to scroll up or
down in the application or select the appropriate tab.
