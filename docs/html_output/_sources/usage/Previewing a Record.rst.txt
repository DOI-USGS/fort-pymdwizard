Previewing a Record
********

Sometimes it can be helpful to look over or read an entire record.  Within the Metadata Wizard 2.0 there is a built in Preview window that can be accessed at any time by selecting the "Preview" item in the Preview menu.

The window that opens will contain a copy of the entire metadata record rendered using the default stylesheet.
