Previewing a Metadata Record
============================

Sometimes it can be helpful to review an entire record as one might read a standard text document. Within the Metadata Wizard there is a built in Preview window that can be accessed at any time by selecting the **Preview** item in the Preview menu.

The preview results display the metadata record using Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) for readability.
