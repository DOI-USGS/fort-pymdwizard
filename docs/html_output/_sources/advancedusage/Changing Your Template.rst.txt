Changing Your Template
********

When you select File->New the Wizard is opening a ‘template’ file and
saving it to a new location. This template is just an FGDC record that
contains default content which forms a solid starting point for a new record.
For example the point of contact, distribution contact,
disclaimers, etc. will often remain the same for most records created by
an individual. Having to update these individually every time a new
record is started can be inconvenient. Keep in mind that anything
specified in the template can be overwritten individually when editing a new
record, they are just the defaults that will pre-populate in the application.

The default template record used by the Metadata Wizard is part of the
standard installation but can be changed to suit the particular needs of
individuals or organizations.

#. Open the Wizard and create a new record, saved to a location where it
   will not be overwritten or inaccessible.
#. Edit this record in the Wizard to contain the content needed in
   subsequent new records. Sections to consider customizing might
   include some or all of:
   
   -  Dataset Point of Contact
   -  Metadata Contact 
   -  Metadata Standard Name
   -  Distribution Information 
   -  ISO 19115 Keywords 
   -  Place Keywords 
   -  Bounding Coordinates
   -  Attribute Accuracy Report
   -  Logical Accuracy Report
   -  Completeness Report
   -  Positional Accuracy

#. Save this record.
#. In the top menu bar click Advanced->Template->Browse to new template,
   and navigate to the xml file saved above.

The template selected will remain active after closing and reopening the
application. If at any time you want to revert to the original Metadata
Wizard template click the Advanced -> Template -> Restore Built-in item.
The current template file name will be displayed at the top of the
Advanced -> Template menu.
