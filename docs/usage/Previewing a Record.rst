Previewing a Record
********

Sometime it can be helpful to look over, or read an entire record.  Within the Wizard there is a build in Preview window that can be accessed at any time by selecting the "Preview" item in the Preview menu.

The window that opens will contain a copy of the entire metadata record rendered using the default stylesheet.
