From\n    the example used above, the domain for the attribute \"road type\"\n    consists of \"heavy duty,\" \"medium duty,\" \"light duty,\" and\n    \"trail.\"  An enumerated domain is one comprised of a list of\n    values. The \"road type\" attribute has an enumerated domain which\n    contains the values \"heavy duty,\" medium duty,\" \"light duty,\" and\n    \"trail.\" In this case, the list of possible values, the\n    definitions of the values, and the sources of the definitions\n    should be provided.\n\n    A range domain is one comprised of a sequence, series, or scale of\n    (usually numeric) values between limits.\n\n    For example, an attribute of age might have a range domain of\n    integers from 0 to 100. In this case, the minimum and maximum\n    values should be provided.\n\n    A codeset domain is one in which the data values of defined by a\n    set of codes. Examples include the Federal Information Processing\n    Standards that contain numeric codes for nations, States, and\n    counties. In this case, the title of the publication containing\n    the code set and the source of the codeset should be provided.\n\n    An unrepresentable domain is one for which the set of data values\n    cannot be represented. Reasons include attributes whose values do\n    not exist in a known, predefined set (for example, the values for\n    an attribute of people\u2019s names), or attributes whose values cannot\n    be depicted using the forms of representation (available character\n    set, etc) used for the metadata. In these cases, the information\n    content of the set of values should be provided.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFAQ:     What is the purpose of the \"Attribute\" compound element at the\n         end of the \"Enumerated Domain\" and \"Range Domain\" compound\n         elements?\n\n    Comments provided during the public review requested the ability\n    to document a construct named \"attribute of attribute value.\" This\n    construct allows additional information to be provided about an\n    attribute value assigned to an entity.

Indirect spatial reference methods\n    usually use a geographic feature, such as a county, state,\n    township or section of the Public Land Survey System, or a road,\n    to uniquely identify a place. The reference may use the name of\n    the feature) for example \"Westmoreland County\") or a code that\n    identifies the feature (such as a county FIPS code). Other\n    examples of indirect spatial references include street addresses,\n    linear reference systems, and River Reach codes.\n\n    - ---\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFAQ:     Why are indirect spatial references included in the metadata\n         standards?\n\n    Indirect spatial references are included because they are a very\n    common means by which observations or other attribute information\n    are tied to a place. The location of many socioeconomic,\n    environmental, and other data often are referenced by identifying\n    a unit of political geography (e.g. a city, county, or state),\n    census geography (e.g. block, block group, or tract), street\n    address, linear referencing systems (e.g.\n\n    milepost), and so on. While these indirect spatial references\n    alone may not be sufficient for geographic analyses, they can\n    serve as a means to link the attribute data to coordinate\n    descriptions of the places to which the attribute data apply.\n\n    - ---\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"}, "metuc": {"long_name": "Metadata Use Constraints", "annotation": "7.9 Metadata Use Constraints --  restrictions and legal prerequisites\n    for using the metadata after access is granted.

Usually, many sources\n         and many processes are used to develop a data set of\n         geospatial data. How can the sources and the process steps be\n         linked? One could describe each source used in the\n         description of each processing step, or describe all the\n         processing steps in which each source participates in the\n         description of the sources. A between way would be to link\n         the source descriptions to the appropriate processing steps.\n         The standards do this through the source abbreviations. How\n         can the sources and the processing steps be linked? Assign a\n         unique abbreviation to each source. The standards do not\n         describe how to create the abbreviation. One means is to use\n         the Originator and Publication Data of the source. Other\n         styles also are possible. For example, a discipline that had\n         a standard style for citing references in professional papers\n         might choose that style for the abbreviation. Large\n         organizations that have a library of source materials may\n         choose to use the library\u2019s unique identifier for each source\n         as the abbreviation. The most important thing is that each\n         source must have a unique abbreviation. Source Information\n         Source Citation  Originator: Smith, Robert A.

The\n         \"Source Produced Citation Abbreviation\" is used when a\n         process generates an intermediate data set that an\n         organization wishes to note separately. To use this feature,\n         the intermediate data set must be documented as a source. It\n         can be referenced by any processing step. - --- For example\n         (see figures at right), an organization (named Agency A),\n         might compile wetlands information on an orthophoto and then\n         digitizes wetlands information. The organization wishes to\n         document the activity using the standards, and requires that\n         the compilation and digitizing process steps be described\n         separately. In addition, the organization obtained the\n         orthophoto from another organization (named Company B).\n         Source  Information Process Steps  Process Step  Process\n         description: Compile  Wetlands on orthophoto  \u2026.

In the\n         second step, the wetlands are digitized from the annotated\n         orthophoto. But from what source?\n\n    One choice is source Company B 1993, although that source (the\n    orthophoto) does not have the compiled wetlands information.\n\n    Another choice is to have the first process step produce a\n    \"source\" which is the annotated orthophoto. This source would be\n    described using the Source Information element, and abbreviated as\n    Agency A 1994.

The Entity\n    and Attribute Information section provides the way for a producer\n    to describe the meaning of this nonspatial entity, attribute, and\n    attribute value information so a user can understand the\n    information content of a data set and use the data appropriately.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFAQ:     What is the difference between the Detailed Description and\n         Overview Description elements?\n\n    As stated above, users must have access to the meanings of the\n    entities, attributes, and attribute values in a data set. The\n    Detailed Description provides the elements needed to describe\n    these meanings.\n\n    In developing the metadata standards, reviewers noted that they\n    often had complete data dictionaries for the entity, attribute,\n    and attribute value information, and preferred to refer to the\n    existing descriptions instead of duplicating them. The Overview\n    Description provides the elements needed to give users a sense of\n    the information content and a reference to the source(s) of the\n    complete description. Note that the Overview Description does not\n    relive the producer of the responsibility to provide a complete\n    description. The Overview Description elements refers to the\n    source of the complete description, and do not allow a producer\n    merely to summarize the information content.\n\n    The two approaches can be used together to document a data set.\n    The Overview Description would be used to describe data for which\n    a complete description is available elsewhere; the Detailed\n    Description would be used to describe data for which a complete\n    description has not been compiled elsewhere.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"}, "plance": {"long_name": "Planar Coordinate Encoding Method", "annotation": "4.1.2.4.1 Planar Coordinate Encoding Method --  the means used to\n          represent horizontal positions.\n\n       Type: text\n       Domain:  \"coordinate pair\" \"distance and bearing\" \"row and column\""}, "citeinfo": {"long_name": "Citation Information", "annotation": "8 Citation Information --  the recommended reference to be used for\n  the data set.

The official requirements and rules for\n     the development of Profiles are documented in Appendix E of the FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial\n     Metadata (FGDC-STD-001-1998).\n     A profile is subset of the metadata entities and elements of the base standard that describes the application of the\n     CSDGM Standard to a specific user community. A Profile permits the modifications to the optionality or repeatability\n     of non-mandatory elements and domains, where permitted, in the Standard. Profiles may also contain extended\n     elements.\n     Profiles are formalized through the FGDC standards process or may be used informally by a user community. The\n     FGDC is the approval authority for profiles. To become recognized by the FGDC, a metadata profile must go through\n     the FGDC standards review and approval process\n     There are 5 basic requirements of a profile. A profile must include:\n     \u2022 the basic, minimum set of metadata collected to the specification of this Standard\n     \u2022 all mandatory elements in all mandatory sections.\n     \u2022 all mandatory- if-applicable elements in all mandatory sections, if the data set has the characteristic\n     documented in the element\n     \u2022 all mandatory elements in all mandatory-if-applicable sections if the data set has the characteristic\n     documented in the section\n     \u2022 all mandatory-if-applicable elements in all mandatory-if-applicable sections, if the data set has the\n     characteristic documented in the section\n     The guidelines for creating a profile are:\n     \u2022 A profile must not change the name, definition, or data type of a standard element.\n     \u2022 A profile may impose more stringent conditionality on standard elements than the Standard requires.\n     (Elements that are optional in the Standard may be mandatory in a profile.)\n     \u2022 A profile may contain elements with domains that are more restrictive than the Standard. (Elements whose\n     domains have free text in the Standard may have a closed list of appropriate values in the profile.)\n     \u2022 A profile may restrict the use of domain values allowed by the Standard. For example, if the Standard\n     contains five domain values for a standard element, the profile may specify that its domain consist of three\n     domain values identified in the profile. The profile may require that the user select a value from the three\n     domain values.)\n     \u2022 A profile will not permit anything not allowed by the Standard. (If the Standard element has a domain of\n     three values, without a free text element, the profile will not allow a user to enter anything other than those 3\n     values.)\n     \u2022 Before creating a profile, the metadata producer will check existing registered profiles.\n     \u2022 A profile must be made available to anyone receiving metadata that was collected according to that profile.\n     \u2022 The profile document submitted to the FGDC or formal approval shall contain the same six sections as the\n     introduction section of this Standard. \n     \n     User Defined Extensions\n     One of the significant enhancements of the FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (FGDC-STD-\n     001-1998) is the ability of the metadata producer to extend the base standard, through User Defined Extensions, by\n     defining a set of metadata entities and/or elements that are used by a specific discipline or organization. The official\n     requirements and rules for the development of User Defined Extensions are documented in Appendix D of the FGDC\n     Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (FGDC-STD-001-1998).\n     Extended elements to the Standard may be defined by a data set producer or a user community. Extended elements are\n     elements outside the Standard, but needed by the data set producer. If extended elements are created, they must follow\n     the guidelines.\n     The following rules must be followed when defining extended elements:\n     \u2022 Extended elements must be formally documented within the hierarchical structure of the Standard (Section 0 -\n     \"Metadata\"). When metadata extended elements are used, their existence must be documented in the\n     Metadata Reference Information, element Metadata Extensions. Every effort should be made to logically\n     organize extended elements within the existing sections and structure. Where there is no logical or natural\n     \"fit\", new section(s) and/or subsections may be defined.\n     \u2022 Extended elements must not be used to change the name, definition, type, or domain of a standard element. In\n     particular, an extended element cannot be nested under a data element.\n     \u2022 Extended elements may be defined as compound and may include extended and standard elements as\n     components. If a standard element is included in an extended compound element, no components of the\n     standard element are changed.\n     \u2022 Extended elements, like the standard element \"Single Date/Time\" may appear in multiple places in the\n     metadata set.\n     The basic semantic elements for required for describing a user defined extension are:\n     Extended Element Name -- (Mandatory) -- the name of the element. The name given to the element must not\n     be the name of any other element in the Standard.\n     Domain: free text (Do not duplicate any other Standard element name.)\n     Definition -- (Mandatory) -- the definition of the element.\n     Domain: free text\n     Rationale -- (Optional) -- the reason for creating the Extended element, and its expected uses.\n     Domain: free text\n     Source -- (Mandatory) -- the name of the entity creating the Extended element.\n     Domain: free text\n     Type -- (Mandatory) -- the kind of value to be provided, or \"compound\" if the Extended element contains\n     other elements.\n     Domain: integer, real, text, date, time, compound\n     Domain -- (Mandatory) -- valid values that can be assigned to the data element.

DLG's contain\n     selected base categories of geographic features, and characteristics of these features, in digital form.\n     The information was collected by digitizing maps, or by compiling new information or revising\n     digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information.\n      The data structure for DLG's is based on graph theory, in which a two-dimensional diagram is\n     expressed as a set of spatial objects in a manner that explicitly expresses logical relationships.\n     Applied to a map, this concept is used to encode the spatial relationships between the objects,\n     including such concepts as adjacency and connectivity between objects. A topologically structured\n     data file can support graphic applications, as well as computations and analyses involving the spatial\n     objects and their spatial relationships.\n      Purpose: DLG's depict information about geographic features on or near the surface of the Earth,\n     terrain, and political and administrative units.

Acknowledgement of the U.S. Geological Survey would be appreciated in products derived\n     from these data. \n     \n     Data Quality Information\n     Attribute Accuracy\n      Attribute Accuracy Report: Attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with\n     hard copy plots and/or symbolized display of the digital line graph on an interactive computer\n     graphic system; selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen, are\n     interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, PROSYS software (USGS) tests the\n     attributes against a master set of valid attributes for the hydrography category; it also checks for\n     selected valid attribute combinations, and for valid attributes relative to topology and dimensionality.\n      All attribute data conform to the attribute codes current as of the date of digitizing as described in\n     Part 3: Attribute Codes in \"Standards for Digital Line Graphs\", National Mapping Program\n     Technical Instructions, USGS. Accuracy is estimated to be 98.5 percent. Certain attributes and/or\n     entities, e.g. BEST ESTIMATE, convey data quality information; for details refer to the SDTS Data\n     Dictionary Modules.\n      Logical Consistency Report: Certain node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are\n      collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements. (The GT-polygon corresponds to the\n     DLG area). Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must\n     connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are\n     defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout the transfer, and the chains representing\n     the limits of the file (neatline) are free of gaps. The tests of logical consistency are performed by\n     PROSYS (USGS) program. The neatline is generated by connecting the four corners of the digital\n     file, as established during initialization of the digital file. All data outside the enclosed region are\n     ignored and all data crossing these geographically straight lines are clipped at the neatline.\n     (Exception: Early files may have area pointings outside of the neatline, for those areas which were\n     too small to place the area pointing within, given software constraints at the time of collection.) Data\n     within a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the neatline. Neatline straightening aligns\n     the digitized edges of the digital data with the generated neatline, that is, with the longitude/latitude\n     lines in geographic coordinates. All internal polygons are tested for closure; early files were checked\n     using plots, later files were checked using PROSYS. Certain attributes and/or entities, e.g. closure\n     line, convey data quality information; for details refer to the SDTS Data Dictionary Modules.\n     Throughout the transfer, null values are denoted by adjacent delimiters. When a subfield, either\n     user-defined in Attribute Primary and Attribute Secondary Module records, or in other SDTS\n     Module records, is implemented as fixed-length, the following null scheme is used: (a) when\n     information to be encoded in the subfield is known to be not applicable (undefined, not relevant),\n     then the subfield is valued by a string of spaces; and (b) when the information to be encoded is\n     relevant but unknown (or missing), then the subfield is valued by a string of question marks \"?\".\n      Completeness Report: Data completeness for unrevised digital files reflects the content of the source\n      graphic. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and\n     legibility constraints. If the digital data underwent limited update revision, then the content will\n     include only (1) those features that are photoidentifiable on monoscopic source, supplemented with\n     limited ancillary source, and (2) those features that can not be reliably photoidentified but that are\n     not considered particularly prone to change. If the digital data underwent standard update revision,\n     then the data meets NMD standards for feature content. For information on collection/inclusion\n     criteria, see NMD Product Standards for DLG and Quadrangle Maps, published as the Technical\n     Instructions.\n     Positional Accuracy\n      Horizontal Positional Accuracy\n      Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report: Accuracy of these digital data (if not digitally revised), is\n     based upon the use of source graphics which are compiled to meet National Map Accuracy\n     Standards. NMAS horizontal accuracy requires that at least 90 percent of points tested are within\n     0.02 inches of the true position. The digital data are estimated to contain a horizontal positional error\n     of less than or equal to 0.003 inches standard error in the two component directions relative to the\n     source graphic. NMAS vertical accuracy requires that at least 90% of well defined points tested be\n     within one half contour interval of the correct value. Comparison to the graphic source is used as\n     control to assess digital positional accuracy. Cartographic offsets may be present on the graphic\n     source, due to scale and legibility constraints. Digital map elements require edge alignment between\n     data sets. Data along each quadrangle edge are tested against the data set for the adjacent\n     quadrangle; tests check for positional accuracy between data sets within a 0.02 inches tolerance.\n     Features with like dimensionality, and with or without like attribution, that are within the tolerance\n     are adjusted by moving the feature equally in both data sets. Features outside the tolerance are not \n     \n     moved. All disconnects are identified by edge matching flags that document the mismatch. These\n     edge matching flags are located in the SDTS AHDR Attribute Primary Module in subfields\n     EDGEWS, EDGEWR, EDGENS, EDGENR, EDGEES, EDGEER, EDGESS, and EDGESR. If the\n     digital data underwent limited update revision, then the data meet at least the class 2 positional\n     accuracy specification in the draft \"United States National Cartographic Standards for Spatial\n     Accuracy\". If the digital data underwent standard update revision, then the data meet the class 1\n     positional accuracy specifications.

Quadrangles were referenced to one of the following horizontal datums: the North\n     American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27), NAD 83, Puerto Rico Datum 1940 adjustment, Old Hawaiian\n     Datum, 1963 Guam Datum, or various local datums. Quadrangles were referenced to one of the\n     following vertical datums: National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929, the International Great Lakes\n     Datum of 1955, or mean sea level. Datum information is contained in the SDTS External Spatial\n     Reference Module. The digital data were produced by either scanning or manually digitizing a\n     stable-based copy of the graphic materials. The scanning process captured the digital data at a\n     scanning resolution of at least 0.001 inches; the resulting raster data were vectorized and then\n     attributed on an interactive editing station. Manual digitizing used a digitizing table to capture the\n     digital data at a resolution of at least 0.001 inches; attribution was performed either as the data were\n     digitized, or on an interactive edit station after the digitizing was completed. The determination of\n     the DLG production method was based on various criteria, including feature density, feature\n     symbology, and availability of production systems. Four control points corresponding to the four\n     corners of the quadrangle were used for registration during data collection. An eight parameter\n     projective transformation was performed on the coordinates used in the data collection and editing\n     systems to register the digital data to the internal coordinates used in the USGS Production System\n     (PROSYS), and a four parameter linear transformation was performed from the PROSYS internal\n     coordinates to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid coordinates. These four control points are\n     stored as point objects in the \"NP\" Point-Node Module, and their latitude and longitude are stored in\n     the SDTS AHDR Attribute Primary Module. The DLG data were checked for position by comparing\n     plots of the digital data to the graphic source. DLG data classification was checked by comparing\n     plots of the digital data to the graphic source and/or using PROSYS verification software. The\n     revision status and category of revision of this digital file (limited update or standard update) is\n     indicated in the SDTS AHDR Attribute Primary Module. Limited update revision uses monoscopic\n     imagery and limited ancillary source, with no field verification; standard update revision uses\n     stereoscopic imagery as needed, in addition to monoscopic imagery and field verification. Certain\n     attributes and/or entities, e.g. PHOTOREVISED, convey data quality information; for details refer\n     to the SDTS Data Dictionary Modules. The DLG outside area is converted to the SDTS Universe\n     Polygon object. The Universe Polygon can be identified by the object representation code \"PW\"; \n     \n     the Universe Polygon does not reference any attributes. DLG areas coded as \"void area\" are\n     converted to the SDTS Void Polygon object. Void Polygons can be identified by the object\n     representation code of \"PX\"; Void Polygons do not reference any attributes.

Some DLG-3 attribute codes identify real world entities, other codes represent attributes of\n     those entities. Hydrography (major code: 050) contains information about streams, bodies of water,\n     wetlands, coastal waters, and water used for transportation. Vegetative features, which are\n     associated with wetlands or submerged areas, are included, as are manmade hydrologic features.\n     The direction of the water flow is captured. This information is not collected for specific hydrologic\n     studies or for navigational assistance. The SDTS model of spatial phenomena describes the real\n     world as consisting of entities which are characterized by attributes which have attribute values.\n     DLG-3 does not explicitly use this entity-attribute-attribute value model. The SDTS implementation\n     of DLG-3 identifies which DLG-3 attribute codes identify entities and which identify attributes of\n     those entities.\n      Entity and Attribute Detail Citation: The USGS document Standards for Digital Line Graphs, Part 3:\n      Attribute Codes, contains a detailed description of each attribute code and a reference to the\n     associated map symbols on the map source materials.

This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5 minute by 7.5 minute\n     blocks containing ground planimetric coordinates of wetlands point, line, and area features and\n     wetlands attributes. When completed, the series will provide coverage for all of the contiguous\n     United States, Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. protectorates in the Pacific and Caribbean. The digital data\n     as well as the hardcopy maps that were used as the source for the digital data are produced and\n     distributed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory project.\n      Purpose: The data provide consultants, planners, and resource managers with information on\n     wetland location and type.

In addition,\n     WAMS software (USFWS-NWI) tests the attributes against a master set of valid wetland attributes.\n     Logical Consistency Report: Polygons intersecting the neatline are closed along the border. Segments making up the\n     outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area. Line segments are a\n     set of sequentially numbered coordinate pairs. No duplicate features exist nor duplicate points in a data\n     string. Intersecting lines are separated into individual line segments at the point of intersection. Point data\n     are represented by two sets of coordinate pairs, each with the same coordinate values. All nodes are\n     represented by a single coordinate pair which indicates the beginning or end of a line segment. The neatline\n     is generated by connecting the four corners of the digital file, as established during initialization of the digital\n     file. All data crossing the neatline are clipped to the neatline and data within a specified tolerance of the\n     neatline are snapped to the neatline. Tests for logical consistency are performed by WAMS verification\n     software (USFWS-NWI).\n     Completeness Report: All photo-interpretable wetlands are mapped. In the treeless prairies, 1/4 acre wetlands are\n     mapped. In forested areas, small open water and emergent wetlands are mapped. In general, the minimum\n     mapping unit is from 1 to 3 acres depending on the wetland type and the scale and emulsion of the source\n     aerial photography. In regions of the country where evergreen forested wetlands predominate, wetlands\n     smaller than 3 acres may not be mapped. Thus, a detailed on-the-ground and historical analysis of a single\n     site may result in a revision of the wetland boundaries established through photographic interpretation. In\n     addition, some small wetlands and those obscured by dense forest cover may not be included in this dataset.\n     Positional Accuracy\n      Horizontal Positional Accuracy\n      Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report: Horizontal positional accuracy for the digital data\n     is tested by visual comparison of the source with hard copy plots.\n     Lineage\n      Source Information\n      Source Citation\n      Originator: U.S. Geological Survey\n      Publication Date: 198811\n      Title: National High Altitude Program (NHAP)\n      Geospatial Data Presentation Form: remote-sensing image\n      Source Scale Denominator: 65000\n      Type of Source Media: black and white aerial photograph film transparency\n      Source Time Period of Content\n      Single Date/Time\n      Calendar Date: 198811\n      Source Currentness Reference: source photography date\n      Source Citation Abbreviation: NWI1a\n      Source Contribution: aerial photo from which wetlands spatial and attribute \n     \n     information are interpreted\n      Source Information\n      Source Citation\n      Originator: U.S. Geological Survey\n      Publication Date: 199010\n      Title: National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP)\n      Geospatial Data Presentation Form: remote-sensing image\n      Source Scale Denominator: 40000\n      Type of Source Media: black and white aerial photograph film transparency\n      Source Time Period of Content\n      Single Date/Time\n      Calendar Date: 199010\n      Source Currentness Reference: source photography date\n      Source Citation Abbreviation: NWI1b\n      Source Contribution: aerial photo from which wetlands spatial and attribute\n     information are interpreted\n      Source Information\n      Source Citation\n      Originator: U.S. Geological Survey\n      Publication Date: 1979\n      Title: Hickory\n      Geospatial Data Presentation Form: map\n      Publication Information\n      Publication Place: Reston, Virginia\n      Publisher: U.S. Geological Survey\n      Source Scale Denominator: 24000\n      Type of Source Media: stable-base material\n      Source Time Period of Content\n      Single Date/Time\n      Calendar Date: 1979\n      Source Currentness Reference: publication date\n      Source Citation Abbreviation: NWI2\n      Source Contribution: base map on which wetlands delineations are registered.\n      Source Information\n      Source Citation\n      Originator: U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory\n      Publication Date: 1992\n      Title: Hickory NWI map\n      Geospatial Data Presentation Form: map\n      Publication Information\n      Publication Place: St. Petersburg, Florida\n      Publisher: U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory\n      Source Scale Denominator: 24000\n      Type of Source Media: stable-base material\n      Source Time Period of Content\n      Single Date/Time\n      Calendar Date: 1992\n      Source Currentness Reference: publication date\n      Source Citation Abbreviation: NWI3\n      Source Contribution: source material from which compiled wetlands location and\n     classification are digitized\n      Process Step\n      Process Description: NWI maps are compiled through manual photointerpretation of\n     NHAP or NAPP aerial photography, supplemented by soil surveys and field checking of\n     wetland photo signatures.

For purposes of this classification wetlands must have one or more of the\n     following three attributes: 1) at least periodically, the land supports predominantly\n     hydrophytes; 2) the substrate is predominantly undrained hydric soil; and 3) the substrate is\n     non-soil and is saturated with water or covered by shallow water at some time during the \n     \n     growing season of each year.\n      Entity Type Definition Source: Cowardin, L.M., V.

The five\n     systems include Marine (open ocean and associated coastline), Estuarine (salt marshes and\n     brackish tidal water), Riverine (rivers, creeks, and streams), Lacustrine (lakes and deep\n     ponds), and Palustrine (shallow ponds, marshes, swamps, sloughs). Systems are further\n     subdivided into subsystems which reflect hydrologic conditions. Below the subsystem is\n     the class which describes the appearance of the wetland in terms of vegetation or substrate.\n     Each class is further subdivided into subclasses; vegetated subclasses are described in terms\n     of life form and substrate subclasses in terms of composition. The classification system also\n     includes modifiers to describe hydrology (water regime), soils, water chemistry (pH,\n     salinity), and special modifiers relating to man's activities (e.g., impounded, partly drained).\n      Attribute Definition Source: Cowardin, L.M., V.
