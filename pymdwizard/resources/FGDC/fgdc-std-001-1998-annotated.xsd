	 FGDC Metadata XML Schema 1.0.0 20030801

	 This is the XML Schema for formal metadata, metadata conforming to
	 the Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata of the Federal
	 Geographic Data Committee.  This schema corresponds to the June,
	 1998 version of the standard, FGDC-STD-001-1998.

	 This file is the primary XML Schema and loads the definitions for
	 sections 1-10 of the standard from separate schema modules.

	 Element names:
	     Element names are a maximum of 8-characters long, to coincide
	     with the Reference Concrete Syntax.

	 Element ordering:
	     Generally the order of elements is now significant.  XML makes
	     it difficult to write a DTD that allows elements to be in any
	     order.  Although XML Schemas do not have this restriction, it
	     was decided to keep the significance of element order in order
	     not to break the DTD validity of XML-encoded metadata files.

	 Authors:
	     Richard E. Rathmann (PSGS/NOAA Coastal Services Center,
	     Charleston, SC) with assistance from Mike Moeller (PSGS/NOAA
	     CSC) and Doug Nebert (Federal Geographic Data Committee).

	 Revisions:
	     20020826 (RER) Locally scoped the definition of "onlink" in
	                      Section 7 (7.11.1) within "metextns" (7.11)
	                      rather than referencing "onlink" definition in
	                      Section 8 (8.10).
	     20030801 (RER) Removed 'xml:space="preserve"' from all
	                      'xsd:documentation' elements.  I originally put
	                      this in to say "whitespace is significant", but
	                      both XML Spy and IBM's  Schema Quality Checker
	                      complain about them.
	     20030801 (RER) Corrected the second regular expression pattern
	                      for the "FGDCtime" simple type in this schema
	                      module.  The "-" in the "[+-]" character class
	                      for the sign character needed to be escaped, as
	                      in "[+\-]".
	     20030801 (RER) Changed types of "srcused" (2.5.2.2) and "srcprod"
	                      (2.5.2.5) in Section 2 to reference the type
	                      defined for "srccitea" (2.5.1.5) to comply with
	                      XML Schema constraint that key/keyref field
	                      value pairs be of the same type.

       Type: compound



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     What is the purpose of the Entity and Attribute Information
         section?

    Users of a data set need to know the meaning of entity, attribute,
    and attribute value information associated with the spatial
    information. For example, a data set might include the entity
    "road". A "road" might have the attribute "road type," which can
    be assigned the attribute values of "heavy duty," "medium duty,"
    "light duty," or "trail." The producer of the data set may have
    different definitions for "road," "road type," "heavy duty,"
    "medium duty," "light duty," or "trail" than a user. The Entity
    and Attribute Information section provides the way for a producer
    to describe the meaning of this nonspatial entity, attribute, and
    attribute value information so a user can understand the
    information content of a data set and use the data appropriately.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     What is the difference between the Detailed Description and
         Overview Description elements?

    As stated above, users must have access to the meanings of the
    entities, attributes, and attribute values in a data set. The
    Detailed Description provides the elements needed to describe
    these meanings.

    In developing the metadata standards, reviewers noted that they
    often had complete data dictionaries for the entity, attribute,
    and attribute value information, and preferred to refer to the
    existing descriptions instead of duplicating them. The Overview
    Description provides the elements needed to give users a sense of
    the information content and a reference to the source(s) of the
    complete description. Note that the Overview Description does not
    relive the producer of the responsibility to provide a complete
    description. The Overview Description elements refers to the
    source of the complete description, and do not allow a producer
    merely to summarize the information content.

    The two approaches can be used together to document a data set.
    The Overview Description would be used to describe data for which
    a complete description is available elsewhere; the Detailed
    Description would be used to describe data for which a complete
    description has not been compiled elsewhere.

FAQ:     What is the purpose of the keywords?

    A keyword is a work or phrase that signifies the meaning or main
    ideas of a data set. They often are used as an index to the
    contents of a data set. The standards provide for four types of
    keywords: theme (the subject of the data set, such as wetlands,
    vegetation, etc.), place (the geographic location of the data set,
    such as Montgomery County, Yellowstone National Park), stratum
    (the vertical location of the data set, such as seafloor, seabed,
    troposphere, stratosphere), and temporal (time references for a
    data set, such as preColumbian, World War II).

    The "Originator" is the person(s) and organization(s) that
    developed the data set. The "Point of Contact" is the person(s)
    and organization(s) that can be contacted if questions arise about
    the data set. The "Originator" and the "Point of Contact" may be
    the same.

    the data set, the results of an application that used the data
    set, different aspects of the quality of the data set, or other
    information. Examples: The map is a reduced-scale plot of the DLG
    hydrography overlay for Wilmington South, DelawareNew Jersey. The
    data were digitized from a 1:24,000- scale topographic map
    quadrangle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     What does the &#x201C;currentness reference&#x201D; mean?

    Information about the currentness of a data set (that is,
    information about how &#x201C;up-to-date&#x201D; is a data set) is important to
    many, if not most, potential users. Most users are interested in
    the currentness of a data set related to the &#x201C;ground condition&#x201D;
    (that is, when the &#x201C;real world&#x201D; looked the way it s described in
    the data set). Unfortunately, sometimes only the time that the
    information was recorded or published is known. The Currentness
    Reference element requires the producer to identify if the Time
    Period of Content dates and times refer to the ground condition,
    or some later time when the information was recorded, published,
    etc.

FAQ:     What is a G-Polygon? What is a G-Ring? What is the difference
         between an "outer" and "inner" G-Ring?

    The Terminology of G-Polygon and G-Ring is taken from the Spatial
    Data Transfer Standard. In simple terms, a G-Polygon is a closed,
    connected (contiguous) area. A G-Ring is a set of coordinates that
    defines a boundary of the area. The first and last points in the
    set of coordinates must be the same. The "outer" GRing describes
    the outside edge of the G-Polygon. "Inner" G-Rings describe any
    "holes" that may occur in the G-Polygon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     What is the difference between the Bounding Coordinates and the
         Data Set G-Polygon?

    The Bounding Coordinates are the west-,east-, north-, The g-rings
    that describe the Data Set G-Polygon and south-most extent of the
    data set. form the outline of the data set.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     Why do the standards allow both Bounding Coordinates and Data Set
         G-Polygons? Why are Bounding Coordinates mandatory, and the
         Data Set G-Polygons optional?

    The purpose of the Spatial Domain element is to describe the
    &#x201C;footprint&#x201D; of the data set. This footprint can be used for
    spatial searches in data catalogs and other purposes.

    Comments received during the development of the standards
    recommended requiring the Bounding Hole G-Polygon Outer G-Ring
    Inner G-Ring Point Coordinates instead of the more demanding (but
    more exact) Data Set G-Polygons. To provide a common means of
    conducting spatial searches on all metadata, Bounding Coordinates
    were made mandatory, Many users indicated a desire to provide the
    data Set G-Polygons to allow the results of spatial searches to be
    more exact, and so the Data Set G-Polygon elements were added as
    an option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     Why are the g-rings composed of four or more points?

    A triangle can be represented by three points.

    The ring must be closed (that is, the first and last points must
    be the same). So the minimum number of points to describe a
    triangle is four (point 1, point 2, point 3, point 1).

FAQ:     What does SDTS say about logical consistency? Logical Consistency
         A report on logical consistency shall describe the fidelity
         of relationships encoded in the data structure of the digital
         spatial data. The report shall detail the tests performed and
         the results of the tests. Tests of Valid Values. Tests for
         permissible values may be applied to any data structure. Such
         a test can detect gross blunders, but it does not ensure all
         aspects of logical consistency. General Tests for Graphic
         Data. A data base containing lines may be subjected to the
         following general  questions: -Do lines intersect only where
         intended? -Are any lines entered twice? -Are all areas
         completely described? -Are there any overshoots or
         undershoots? -Are any polygons too small, or any lines too
         close?

    Different tests may be applied to address these questions, but the
    quality report shall contain a description of the tests applied or
    a reference to documentation of the software used. The report
    shall state whether all inconsistencies were corrected or it shall
    detail the remaining errors by case.

    Specific Topological Tests. For exhaustive areal coverage date
    transmitted as chains or derived from chains, it is permissible to
    report logical consistency as "Topologically Clean" under the
    condition that an automated procedure has verified the following
    conditions: (a) All chains intersect at nodes. Use of exact case
    or tolerance shall be reported.

    (b) Cycles of chains and nodes are consistent around polygons. Or,
    alternatively, cycles of chains and polygons are consistent around
    nodes.

    c) Inner rings embed consistently in enclosing polygons.

    The quality report shall identify the software (name and version)
    used to verify these conditions.

    Date of Test. The report shall include the date on which the tests
    were applied. If corrections and modifications have occurred after
    the test for logical consistency, the quality report shall
    indicate how the new information was checked for logical
    consistency.

FAQ:     What does SDTS say about completeness?

    Completeness The quality report shall include information about
    selection criteria, definitions used and other relevant mapping
    rules. For example, geometric thresholds such as minimum area or
    minimum width shall be reported.

    In encoding spatial entities, standard geocodes (such as described
    in the FIPS codes for States, counties, municipalities, and
    places) shall be employed if possible. Deviations from standard
    definitions and interpretations shall be described.

    The report on completeness shall describe the relationship between
    the objects represented and the abstract universe of all such
    objects. In particular, the report shall describe the
    exhaustiveness of a set of features. Exhaustiveness concerns
    spatial and taxonomic (attribute) properties, both of which can be
    tested. A test for spatial completeness can be obtained from
    topological tests for  logical consistency described in 3.4.3 [of
    SDTS]. Tests for taxonomic completeness operate by comparison of a
    master list of geocodes to the codes actually appearing in the
    file. The procedures used for testing and the results shall be
    described in the quality report.

FAQ:     What is the difference between the Attribute Accuracy Report and
         the Quantitative Attribute Accuracy Assessment?

    [This answer applies to both the attribute and positional accuracy
    elements.] The Attribute Accuracy Report is a complete description
    of the accuracy of the attribute information in the data set,
    include the  identification of tests used, testing methodology,
    results obtained, etc.

    In developing the metadata standard, reviewers asked that a
    summary method of providing results also be permitted. While this
    summary method would not relieve producers of the obligation to
    provide a thorough report, it would allow users, especially those
    using a data catalog, to quickly exclude those data sets that
    obviously would not serve a user&#x2019;s needs. The Quantitative
    Attribute Accuracy Assessment (and its horizontal and vertical
    accuracy counterparts) were provided in response to this request.
    A producer identifies the test used by name and the value obtained
    from the test. The derivation of these values should be described
    in the accuracy reports.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     What does SDTS say about attribute accuracy?

    Attribute Accuracy Accuracy assessment for measures on a
    continuous scale shall be performed using procedures similar to
    those used for positional accuracy (providing a numerical estimate
    of expected discrepancies). The report of a test of attribute
    accuracy shall include the data of the test and the dates of the
    materials used. In the case of different dates, the report shall
    describe the rates of change in the phenomena classified. Spatial
    variations in attribute accuracy may be reported in a quality
    overlay.

    Accuracy tests for categorical attributes may be performed by one
    of the following methods. All methods shall make reference to map
    scale in interpreting classifications.

    Deductive Estimate Any estimate, even a guess based on experience,
    is permitted, The basis for the deduction shall be explained.
    Statements such as "good" or "poor" should be explained in as
    quantitative a manner as possible.

    Tests based on Independent Samples. A misclassification matrix
    shall be reported as counts of sample units cross-tabulated by the
    categories of the sample and of the tested material. The sampling
    procedure and the location of sample units shall be described.

    Tests Based on Polygon Overlay. A misclassification matrix shall
    be reported as areas. The relationship between the two maps shall
    be explained; as far as possible, the two sources should be
    independent and on should have higher accuracy.

FAQ:     What is the difference between the positional accuracy reports
         and the positional quantitative accuracy assessments?

    See faq for Attribute Accuracy (element 2.1).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     What does SDTS say about positional accuracy?

    Positional Accuracy The quality report portion on positional
    accuracy shall include the degree of compliance to the spatial
    registration standard (see section 4.1.3.5 [of SDTS]. Quality of
    control surveys shall be reported by using the procedures
    established in the geodetic standard. If a separate control survey
    has been used, it shall be described in the standard form, even if
    results fall below the recognized classification thresholds.

    Descriptions of positional accuracy shall consider the quality of
    the final product after all transformations. The information on
    transformations forms a part of the lineage portion of the quality
    report.

    The report of any test of positional accuracy shall include the
    date of the test. Variations in positional accuracy shall be
    reported either as additional attributes of each spatial object of
    through a quality overlay (reliability diagram).

    Measures of positional accuracy may be obtained by one of the
    following optional methods.

    Deductive Estimate. Any deductive statement based on knowledge of
    errors in each production step shall include reference to complete
    calibration tests and shall also describe assumptions concerning
    error propagation. Results from deductive estimates shall be
    distinguished from results of other tests.

    Internal Evidence. Federal Geodetic Control Committee procedures
    will be used for tests based on repeated measurement and
    redundancy such as closure of traverse or residuals from an
    adjustment.

    Comparison to Source. When using graphic inspection of results
    ("check plots"), the geometric tolerances applied shall be
    reported and the method of registration shall also be described.
    Use of check plots shall be included in the lineage portion.

    Independent Source of Higher Accuracy. The preferred test for
    positional accuracy is a comparison to an independent source of
    higher accuracy. The test shall be conducted using the rules
    prescribed in the &#x201C;ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large Scale Maps&#x201D;
    (see 1.3.3 [of SDTS]).

    When the dates of testing and source material differ, the report
    shall describe the procedures used  to ensure that the results
    relate to positional error and not to temporal effects. The
    numerical results in ground units, as well as the number and
    location of the test points, shall be reported. A statement of
    compliance to a particular threshold is not adequate in itself.
    This test may only be applicable to well-defined points.

FAQ:     How do the "Source Citation Abbreviation" and "Source Used
         Citation Abbreviation" work? The standards are a set of
         sources (the "Source Information" element) and a set of
         processes (the "Process Step" element). Usually, many sources
         and many processes are used to develop a data set of
         geospatial data. How can the sources and the process steps be
         linked? One could describe each source used in the
         description of each processing step, or describe all the
         processing steps in which each source participates in the
         description of the sources. A between way would be to link
         the source descriptions to the appropriate processing steps.
         The standards do this through the source abbreviations. How
         can the sources and the processing steps be linked? Assign a
         unique abbreviation to each source. The standards do not
         describe how to create the abbreviation. One means is to use
         the Originator and Publication Data of the source. Other
         styles also are possible. For example, a discipline that had
         a standard style for citing references in professional papers
         might choose that style for the abbreviation. Large
         organizations that have a library of source materials may
         choose to use the library&#x2019;s unique identifier for each source
         as the abbreviation. The most important thing is that each
         source must have a unique abbreviation. Source Information

FAQ:     How does the "Source Produced Citation Abbreviation" work? The
         "Source Produced Citation Abbreviation" is used when a
         process generates an intermediate data set that an
         organization wishes to note separately. To use this feature,
         the intermediate data set must be documented as a source. It
         can be referenced by any processing step. For example (see
         figures at right), an organization (named Agency A), might
         compile wetlands information on an orthophoto and then
         digitizes wetlands information. The organization wishes to
         document the activity using the standards, and requires that
         the compilation and digitizing process steps be described
         separately. In addition, the organization obtained the
         orthophoto from another organization (named Company B).

         Agency A 1994 In the first process step, wetlands are
         compiled onto the orthophoto (source Company B 1993). In the
         second step, the wetlands are digitized from the annotated
         orthophoto. But from what source?

    One choice is source Company B 1993, although that source (the
    orthophoto) does not have the compiled wetlands information.

    Another choice is to have the first process step produce a
    "source" which is the annotated orthophoto. This source would be
    described using the Source Information element, and abbreviated as
    Agency A 1994. Source Agency A 1994 (the annotated orthophoto) can
    then be referenced by subsequent process steps.

FAQ:     What does SDTS say about lineage?

    Lineage The lineage portion of a quality report shall include a
    description of the source material from which the data were
    derived and the methods of derivation, including all
    transformations involved in producing the final digital files. The
    description shall include the dates of the source material and the
    dates of ancillary information used for update. The date assigned
    to a source shall reflect the date that the information
    corresponds to the ground; however, if this date in not known,
    then a date of publication may be used, if declared as such.

    Any data base created by merging information obtained from
    distinct sources shall be described in sufficient detail to
    identify the actual source for each element in the file. In these
    cases, either a lineage code on each element or a quality overlay
    (course data index, etc.) shall be required.

    The lineage portion shall also include reference to the specific
    control information used. Control form the National Geodetic
    Reference System shall be identified according to identifiers in
    that system, while other points used for control shall be
    described with sufficient detail to allow recovery.

    The lineage portion shall describe the mathematical
    transformations of coordinates used in each step from the source
    material to the final product. The locations of any registration
    point for coordinate transformations shall be given. The methods
    used to make coordinate transformations shall be documented. To
    fulfill this standard, it is acceptable to make reference to
    separate documentation for the coordinate transformation algorithm
    used, but the specific parameters applied shall be described for
    the particular case. Documentation of a transformation algorithm
    shall include the nature of computational steps taken to avoid
    loss of digits through roundoff and  shall include a set of sample
    computations including numerical values of coefficients to confirm
    equivalence of transformations. The documentation of a
    transformation algorithm shall be available on request by a user
    obtaining digital data even if that user is not licensed to use
    the particular software.

     features, addressing schemes, or other means through which
     locations are referenced in the data set.

       Type: text
       Domain:  free text



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     What is an indirect spatial reference?

    An indirect spatial reference is any way to describe a location
    without using coordinates. Indirect spatial reference methods
    usually use a geographic feature, such as a county, state,
    township or section of the Public Land Survey System, or a road,
    to uniquely identify a place. The reference may use the name of
    the feature) for example "Westmoreland County") or a code that
    identifies the feature (such as a county FIPS code). Other
    examples of indirect spatial references include street addresses,
    linear reference systems, and River Reach codes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     Why are indirect spatial references included in the metadata
         standards?

    Indirect spatial references are included because they are a very
    common means by which observations or other attribute information
    are tied to a place. The location of many socioeconomic,
    environmental, and other data often are referenced by identifying
    a unit of political geography (e.g.

    a city, county, or state), census geography (e.g. block, block
    group, or tract), street address, linear referencing systems (e.g.
    milepost), and so on. While these indirect spatial references
    alone may not be sufficient for geographic analyses, they can
    serve as a means to link the attribute data to coordinate
    descriptions of the places to which the attribute data apply.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     Where can I record the resolution of the raster objects?

    Coordinate resolution information is encoded in section 4. For
    raster data recorded in geographic (longitude-latitude)
    coordinates, use "Latitude Resolution" (4.1.1.1) and "Longitude
    Resolution" (4.1.1.2). For planar (x-y) coordinates, use "Abscissa
    Resolution" (4.1.2.4.2.1) and "Ordinate Resolution" (4.1.2.4.2.2).
    For other (local) systems, include resolution information in
    "Local Description" (4.1.3.1). The resolution of vertical
    measurements should be provided in "Altitude Resolution" (4.2.1.2)
    for altitudes or elevations and "Depth Resolution" (4.2.2.2) for
    depths.

FAQ:     (!) Do I really need to do all the map projections that follow?
         all the grid systems that follow?

    (!) Remember that the purpose of the metadata standards is to
    allow the description of data sets. The standards provide explicit
    means to encode parameters for map projections and grid systems
    that are commonly used in the United States, as well as the means
    to develop encodings of parameters for map projections and grid
    systems that are used less frequently. You only need to use the
    parts of the standards for the maps projections and grid systems
    that you use in your data sets. The rest of the map projections
    and grid systems don&#x2019;t apply to you; ignore them.

FAQ:     What is the "local planar" system?

    A local planar coordinate system is any planar coordinate system
    for which the relationship between the planar coordinates and
    geographic (latitude and longitude) coordinates is not known.

    In these cases, the standards ask the producer to describe the
    coordinate system (the orientation of the axes, etc.) And any
    means that can be used to link the local system to geographic
    coordinates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     What is meant by coordinate resolution?

    The coordinate resolution is the smallest difference that can be
    encoded between the adjacent coordinate values in the data set. In
    raster data sets, these values normally are the dimensions of  the
    pixel or grid cell. In vector data sets, the resolution is the
    shortest line that can be encoded in the data set.

FAQ:     What is a domain? an enumerated domain? a range domain? a codeset
         domain? an unrepresentable domain?

    A domain is the set of possible data values of an attribute. From
    the example used above, the domain for the attribute "road type"
    consists of "heavy duty," "medium duty," "light duty," and
    "trail." An enumerated domain is one comprised of a list of
    values. The "road type" attribute has an enumerated domain which
    contains the values "heavy duty," medium duty," "light duty," and
    "trail." In this case, the list of possible values, the
    definitions of the values, and the sources of the definitions
    should be provided.

    A range domain is one comprised of a sequence, series, or scale of
    (usually numeric) values between limits.

    For example, an attribute of age might have a range domain of
    integers from 0 to 100. In this case, the minimum and maximum
    values should be provided.

    A codeset domain is one in which the data values of defined by a
    set of codes. Examples include the Federal Information Processing
    Standards that contain numeric codes for nations, States, and
    counties. In this case, the title of the publication containing
    the code set and the source of the codeset should be provided.

    An unrepresentable domain is one for which the set of data values
    cannot be represented. Reasons include attributes whose values do
    not exist in a known, predefined set (for example, the values for
    an attribute of people&#x2019;s names), or attributes whose values cannot
    be depicted using the forms of representation (available
    character set, etc) used for the metadata. In these cases, the
    information content of the set of values should be provided.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     What is the purpose of the "Attribute" compound element at the
         end of the "Enumerated Domain" and "Range Domain" compound
         elements?

    Comments provided during the public review requested the ability
    to document a construct named "attribute of attribute value." This
    construct allows additional information to be provided about an
    attribute value  assigned to an entity. For example, an entity
    "well" may have an attribute "product." The attribute values for
    "product" include "water" and other items.

    Additional information about the water from the well may be known.
    Using the "attribute of attribute value" construct, the value
    "water" is assigned attributes (for example "water
    characteristics") that provide this information.

FAQ:     What is the purpose of the Attribute Value Accuracy Information
         element? How does it relate to the Attribute Accuracy element
         in section 2?

    In developing the metadata standards, reviewers asked for the
    ability to report the accuracy of the values assigned to an
    attribute with the definition of the attribute. The ability to
    summarize the accuracy was included as an option. The complete
    report of the accuracy should be included in the Attribute
    Accuracy element in section 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     What is the purpose of the Format Information Content Element?

    In developing the metadata standards, some reviewers noted that
    their data are distributed in a series of files, each of which has
    a different format and information content. For example, the
    spatial data might be distributed in format x, and the attribute
    data in format y. The reviewers asked for the ability to describe
    which data are encoded in which format. The Format Information
    Content element provides this capability: Digital Form  Digital
    Transfer Information  Format Name: x  Format Information Content:
    spatial objects with unique identifies and  coordinate data
    Digital Transfer Information  Format Name: y  Format Information
    Content: attribute data and the unique identifiers of  the spatial
    objects. The identifiers are used to link the spatial objects and
    attributes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     What is a Network Resource Name?

    The name of the data set on the network. When appropriate, Uniform
    Resource Locators (URL) should be provided.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     What is the difference between the Network Resource Name and the
         Online Linkage (8.10) data element?

    The Network Resource Name is the name of the file or service from
    which the data set can be obtained from a distributor. Different
    distributors that provide online access to a data set probably
    would do so from different sites. The Online Linkage is the name
    of the file or service maintained by the originator (when used
    with "Citation" (1.1)) or the name of the file or service from
    which the data set was obtained (when used with "Source Citation"
    (2.5.5.1)).

FAQ:     When is the Geospatial Data Presentation Form element used?

    The Geospatial Data Presentation Form is to identify the (usually
    "cartographic") style (if any) with which the originator intended
    that the information be presented to the user. For example, a
    paper map would have a "map" geospatial presentation form. A
    scanned image of a map also has "map" as the geospatial
    presentation form. Vector data digitized from a map would not have
    a presentation form if no particular method of presenting the data
    to users was intended by the originator.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ:     When is the Larger Work Citation element used?

    Sometimes an item is published as part of a larger volume. For
    example, a map or article originated by John Jones might be
    published in a book compiled by Charlene Smith. The citation for
    the map or article item would include Jones as the originator, the
    date of the item, the title of the item, etc.

    To obtain a copy of the item, however, one would need to find the
    published book. The citation of the book would include Smith as
    the compiler, the publication date of the book , the title of the
    book, etc. This information about the book in which the item was
    published is the Larger Work Citation.

FAQ:     What is the difference between the Contact Person Primary and
         Contact Organization Primary elements?

    In developing the metadata standard, reviewers asked for a way to
    distinguish cases in which the primary contact was a person, whose
    organizational affiliation was incidental, versus those in which
    the primary contact was an organization, whose personnel were
    incidental. The Contact Person Primary element is for the first
    case; the Contact Organization Primary is for the second. Both are
    comprised of the same elements; the difference is which elements
    are mandatory and which are optional.

    Profiles
     One of the significant enhancements of the FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (FGDC-STD-001-
     1998) is the ability of the metadata producer to "profile" the base standard by defining a subset of the metadata
     entities and/or elements that are used by a specific discipline or organization. The official requirements and rules for
     the development of Profiles are documented in Appendix E of the FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial
     Metadata (FGDC-STD-001-1998).
     A profile is subset of the metadata entities and elements of the base standard that describes the application of the
     CSDGM Standard to a specific user community. A Profile permits the modifications to the optionality or repeatability
     of non-mandatory elements and domains, where permitted, in the Standard. Profiles may also contain extended
     elements.
     Profiles are formalized through the FGDC standards process or may be used informally by a user community. The
     FGDC is the approval authority for profiles. To become recognized by the FGDC, a metadata profile must go through
     the FGDC standards review and approval process
     There are 5 basic requirements of a profile. A profile must include:
     &#xB7; the basic, minimum set of metadata collected to the specification of this Standard
     &#xB7; all mandatory elements in all mandatory sections.
     &#xB7; all mandatory- if-applicable elements in all mandatory sections, if the data set has the characteristic
     documented in the element
     &#xB7; all mandatory elements in all mandatory-if-applicable sections if the data set has the characteristic
     documented in the section
     &#xB7; all mandatory-if-applicable elements in all mandatory-if-applicable sections, if the data set has the
     characteristic documented in the section
     The guidelines for creating a profile are:
     &#xB7; A profile must not change the name, definition, or data type of a standard element.
     &#xB7; A profile may impose more stringent conditionality on standard elements than the Standard requires.
     (Elements that are optional in the Standard may be mandatory in a profile.)
     &#xB7; A profile may contain elements with domains that are more restrictive than the Standard. (Elements whose
     domains have free text in the Standard may have a closed list of appropriate values in the profile.)
     &#xB7; A profile may restrict the use of domain values allowed by the Standard. For example, if the Standard
     contains five domain values for a standard element, the profile may specify that its domain consist of three
     domain values identified in the profile. The profile may require that the user select a value from the three
     domain values.)
     &#xB7; A profile will not permit anything not allowed by the Standard. (If the Standard element has a domain of
     three values, without a free text element, the profile will not allow a user to enter anything other than those 3
     values.)
     &#xB7; Before creating a profile, the metadata producer will check existing registered profiles.
     &#xB7; A profile must be made available to anyone receiving metadata that was collected according to that profile.
     &#xB7; The profile document submitted to the FGDC for formal approval shall contain the same six sections as the
     introduction section of this Standard.
     User Defined Extensions
     One of the significant enhancements of the FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (FGDC-STD-001-
     1998) is the ability of the metadata producer to extend the base standard, through User Defined Extensions, by
     defining a set of metadata entities and/or elements that are used by a specific discipline or organization. The official
     requirements and rules for the development of User Defined Extensions are documented in Appendix D of the FGDC
     Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (FGDC-STD-001-1998).
     Extended elements to the Standard may be defined by a data set producer or a user community. Extended elements
     are elements outside the Standard, but needed by the data set producer. If extended elements are created, they must
     follow the guidelines.
     The following rules must be followed when defining extended elements:
     &#xB7; Extended elements must be formally documented within the hierarchical structure of the Standard (Section 0
     - "Metadata"). When metadata extended elements are used, their existence must be documented in the
     Metadata Reference Information, element Metadata_Extensions. Every effort should be made to logically
     organize extended elements within the existing sections and structure. Where there is no logical or natural
     "fit", new section(s) and/or subsections may be defined.
     &#xB7; Extended elements must not be used to change the name, definition, type, or domain of a standard element.
     In particular, an extended element cannot be nested under a data element.
     &#xB7; Extended elements may be defined as compound and may include extended and standard elements as
     components. If a standard element is included in an extended compound element, no components of the
     standard element are changed.
     &#xB7; Extended elements, like the standard element "Single_Date/Time" may appear in multiple places in the
     metadata set.
     The basic semantic elements for required for describing a user defined extension are:
     Extended_Element_Name -- (Mandatory) -- the name of the element. The name given to the element must
     not be the name of any other element in the Standard.
     Domain: free text (Do not duplicate any other Standard element name.)
     Definition -- (Mandatory) -- the definition of the element.
     Domain: free text
     Rationale -- (Optional) -- the reason for creating the Extended element, and its expected uses.
     Domain: free text
     Source -- (Mandatory) -- the name of the entity creating the Extended element.
     Domain: free text
     Type -- (Mandatory) -- the kind of value to be provided, or "compound" if the Extended element contains
     other elements.
     Domain: integer, real, text, date, time, compound
     Domain -- (Mandatory) -- valid values that can be assigned to the data element. The same rules as those for
     Standard elements are applied here.
     Domain: free text
     Short Name -- (Mandatory) -- a unique short name consisting of eight alphabetic characters or less.
     Domain: free text (Do not duplicate another short name used by the Standard or any other short
     name in the Extension Registry.)

     Parent -- (Mandatory) -- The name of the element(s) under which this element may appear. The name(s) may
     be standard or other extended element(s).
     Domain: none, free text (Must be the name of an existing standard or extended element. If the
     extended element is not part of any other compound element, its parent is the section

     Example: U.S. Geological Survey Digital Line Graph file
     The map is a reduced-scale plot of the hydrography overlay from the SDTS-encoded Digital Line Graph data set for
     Wilmington South, Delaware-New Jersey. The data were digitized from a 1:24,000-scale topographic map quadrangle.
     Notes:
     This example makes use of "blanket" statements that describe all activities that might have happened to the
     data. This approach was needed because the data were developed several years ago, and the processes
     applied to these data are not known.
     How could the example be changed? Some improvements might include:
     Reporting only those processes applied to these data.
     Providing several 'processing steps' to describe the development of the data set.
     Providing more optional metadata elements.
     This example is provided only to illustrate metadata that are 'compliant' with the standard (mandatory and

     Description
     Abstract: This data set is a digital line graph (DLG), or line map information. DLG's contain selected base
     categories of geographic features, and characteristics of these features, in digital form. The
     information was collected by digitizing maps, or by compiling new information or revising digitized
     maps using remotely sensed and other information.
     The data structure for DLG's is based on graph theory, in which a two-dimensional diagram is
     expressed as a set of spatial objects in a manner that explicitly expresses logical relationships.
     Applied to a map, this concept is used to encode the spatial relationships between the objects,
     including such concepts as adjacency and connectivity between objects. A topologically
     structured data file can support graphic applications, as well as computations and analyses
     involving the spatial objects and their spatial relationships.
     Purpose: DLG's depict information about geographic features on or near the surface of the Earth, terrain,
     and political and administrative units. These data were collected as part of the National Mapping
     Program.

     Data Quality Information
     Attribute Accuracy
     Attribute Accuracy Report: Attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard
     copy plots and/or symbolized display of the digital line graph on an interactive computer graphic
     system; selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen, are interactively
     queried and verified on screen. In addition, PROSYS software (USGS) tests the attributes against a
     master set of valid attributes for the hydrography category; it also checks for selected valid
     attribute combinations, and for valid attributes relative to topology and dimensionality. All 

     attribute data conform to the attribute codes current as of the date of digitizing as described in Part
     3: Attribute Codes in "Standards for Digital Line Graphs", National Mapping Program Technical
     Instructions, USGS. Accuracy is estimated to be 98.5 percent. Certain attributes and/or entities,
     e.g. BEST_ESTIMATE, convey data quality information; for details refer to the SDTS Data
     Dictionary Modules.
     Logical Consistency Report: Certain node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are
      collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements. (The GT-polygon corresponds to the
     DLG area). Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must
     connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons
     are defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout the transfer, and the chains
     representing the limits of the file (neatline) are free of gaps. The tests of logical consistency are
     performed by PROSYS (USGS) program. The neatline is generated by connecting the four corners
     of the digital file, as established during initialization of the digital file. All data outside the enclosed
     region are ignored and all data crossing these geographically straight lines are clipped at the
     neatline. (Exception: Early files may have area pointings outside of the neatline, for those areas
     which were too small to place the area pointing within, given software constraints at the time of
     collection.) Data within a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the neatline. Neatline
     straightening aligns the digitized edges of the digital data with the generated neatline, that is, with
     the longitude/latitude lines in geographic coordinates. All internal polygons are tested for closure;
     early files were checked using plots, later files were checked using PROSYS. Certain attributes
     and/or entities, e.g. closure line, convey data quality information; for details refer to the SDTS Data
     Dictionary Modules. Throughout the transfer, null values are denoted by adjacent delimiters.
     When a subfield, either user-defined in Attribute Primary and Attribute Secondary Module records,
     or in other SDTS Module records, is implemented as fixed-length, the following null scheme is
     used: (a) when information to be encoded in the subfield is known to be not applicable (undefined,
     not relevant), then the subfield is valued by a string of spaces; and (b) when the information to be
     encoded is relevant but unknown (or missing), then the subfield is valued by a string of question
     marks "?".
     Completeness Report: Data completeness for unrevised digital files reflects the content of the source
      graphic. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and
     legibility constraints. If the digital data underwent limited update revision, then the content will
     include only (1) those features that are photoidentifiable on monoscopic source, supplemented
     with limited ancillary source, and (2) those features that can not be reliably photoidentified but that
     are not considered particularly prone to change. If the digital data underwent standard update
     revision, then the data meets NMD standards for feature content. For information on
     collection/inclusion criteria, see NMD Product Standards for DLG and Quadrangle Maps,
     published as the Technical Instructions.
     Positional Accuracy
     Horizontal Positional Accuracy
     Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report: Accuracy of these digital data (if not digitally revised), is
     based upon the use of source graphics which are compiled to meet National Map
     Accuracy Standards. NMAS horizontal accuracy requires that at least 90 percent of
     points tested are within 0.02 inches of the true position. The digital data are estimated to
     contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inches standard error in
     the two component directions relative to the source graphic. NMAS vertical accuracy
     requires that at least 90% of well defined points tested be within one half contour interval
     of the correct value. Comparison to the graphic source is used as control to assess digital
     positional accuracy. Cartographic offsets may be present on the graphic source, due to
     scale and legibility constraints. Digital map elements require edge alignment between data
     sets. Data along each quadrangle edge are tested against the data set for the adjacent
     quadrangle; tests check for positional accuracy between data sets within a 0.02 inches
     tolerance. Features with like dimensionality, and with or without like attribution, that are
     within the tolerance are adjusted by moving the feature equally in both data sets.
     Features outside the tolerance are not moved. All disconnects are identified by edge
     matching flags that document the mismatch. These edge matching flags are located in the
     SDTS AHDR Attribute Primary Module in subfields EDGEWS, EDGEWR, EDGENS,
     EDGENR, EDGEES, EDGEER, EDGESS, and EDGESR. If the digital data underwent limited 

     update revision, then the data meet at least the class 2 positional accuracy specification in
     the draft "United States National Cartographic Standards for Spatial Accuracy". If the
     digital data underwent standard update revision, then the data meet the class 1 positional
     accuracy specifications. Certain attributes and/or entities, e.g. BEST_ESTIMATE, convey
     data accuracy information; for details refer to the SDTS Data Dictionary Modules.

     Process Step
     Process Description: This Digital Line Graph, (if not digitally revised), was digitized from a
     standard U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) quadrangle (name, date and scale of quadrangle
     indicated in SDTS Identification Module), and was archived in the National Digital
     Cartographic Data Base (NDCDB). Quadrangles were referenced to one of the following
     horizontal datums: the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27), NAD 83, Puerto Rico
     Datum 1940 adjustment, Old Hawaiian Datum, 1963 Guam Datum, or various local datums.
     Quadrangles were referenced to one of the following vertical datums: National Geodetic
     Vertical Datum of 1929, the International Great Lakes Datum of 1955, or mean sea level.
     Datum information is contained in the SDTS External Spatial Reference Module. The
     digital data were produced by either scanning or manually digitizing a stable-based copy
     of the graphic materials. The scanning process captured the digital data at a scanning
     resolution of at least 0.001 inches; the resulting raster data were vectorized and then
     attributed on an interactive editing station. Manual digitizing used a digitizing table to
     capture the digital data at a resolution of at least 0.001 inches; attribution was performed
     either as the data were digitized, or on an interactive edit station after the digitizing was
     completed. The determination of the DLG production method was based on various
     criteria, including feature density, feature symbology, and availability of production
     systems. Four control points corresponding to the four corners of the quadrangle were
     used for registration during data collection. An eight parameter projective transformation
     was performed on the coordinates used in the data collection and editing systems to
     register the digital data to the internal coordinates used in the USGS Production System
     (PROSYS), and a four parameter linear transformation was performed from the PROSYS
     internal coordinates to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid coordinates. These
     four control points are stored as point objects in the "NP" Point-Node Module, and their
     latitude and longitude are stored in the SDTS AHDR Attribute Primary Module. The DLG
     data were checked for position by comparing plots of the digital data to the graphic
     source. DLG data classification was checked by comparing plots of the digital data to the
     graphic source and/or using PROSYS verification software. The revision status and
     category of revision of this digital file (limited update or standard update) is indicated in
     the SDTS AHDR Attribute Primary Module. Limited update revision uses monoscopic
     imagery and limited ancillary source, with no field verification; standard update revision
     uses stereoscopic imagery as needed, in addition to monoscopic imagery and field
     verification. Certain attributes and/or entities, e.g. PHOTOREVISED, convey data quality 

     information; for details refer to the SDTS Data Dictionary Modules. The DLG outside
     area is converted to the SDTS Universe Polygon object. The Universe Polygon can be
     identified by the object representation code "PW"; the Universe Polygon does not
     reference any attributes. DLG areas coded as "void area" are converted to the SDTS Void
     Polygon object. Void Polygons can be identified by the object representation code of
     "PX"; Void Polygons do not reference any attributes. Information on the PROSYS
     program, the attribute standard, and the NDCDB is available from USGS.

     Entity and Attribute Information
     Overview Description
     Entity and Attribute Overview: The DLG-3 scheme assigns any number of attribute codes to spatial objects.
      Some DLG-3 attribute codes identify real world entities, other codes represent attributes of those
     entities. Hydrography (major code: 050) contains information about streams, bodies of water,
     wetlands, coastal waters, and water used for transportation. Vegetative features, which are
     associated with wetlands or submerged areas, are included, as are manmade hydrologic features.
     The direction of the water flow is captured. This information is not collected for specific
     hydrologic studies or for navigational assistance. The SDTS model of spatial phenomena
     describes the real world as consisting of entities which are characterized by attributes which have
     attribute values. DLG-3 does not explicitly use this entity-attribute-attribute value model. The
     SDTS implementation of DLG-3 identifies which DLG-3 attribute codes identify entities and which
     identify attributes of those entities.
     Entity and Attribute Detail Citation: The USGS document Standards for Digital Line Graphs, Part 3:
     Attribute Codes, contains a detailed description of each attribute code and a reference to the
     associated map symbols on the map source materials. The document is available as:

     Native Data Set Environment: NWI uses Wetlands Analytical Mapping System (WAMS) software version 4.06
     running under the SUNOS 4.x operating system to digitize wetlands information.
     Data Quality Information
     Attribute Accuracy
     Attribute Accuracy Report: Attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy
     printouts and/or symbolized display of the digital wetlands data on an interactive computer graphic system.
      In addition, WAMS software (USFWS-NWI) tests the attributes against a master set of valid wetland
     attributes.
     Logical Consistency Report: Polygons intersecting the neatline are closed along the border. Segments making up
     the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area. Line segments
     are a set of sequentially numbered coordinate pairs. No duplicate features exist nor duplicate points in a
     data string. Intersecting lines are separated into individual line segments at the point of intersection. Point
     data are represented by two sets of coordinate pairs, each with the same coordinate values. All nodes are
     represented by a single coordinate pair which indicates the beginning or end of a line segment. The neatline
     is generated by connecting the four corners of the digital file, as established during initialization of the
     digital file. All data crossing the neatline are clipped to the neatline and data within a specified tolerance of
     the neatline are snapped to the neatline. Tests for logical consistency are performed by WAMS verification
     software (USFWS-NWI).
     Completeness Report: All photo-interpretable wetlands are mapped. In the treeless prairies, 1/4 acre wetlands are
     mapped. In forested areas, small open water and emergent wetlands are mapped. In general, the minimum
     mapping unit is from 1 to 3 acres depending on the wetland type and the scale and emulsion of the source
     aerial photography. In regions of the country where evergreen forested wetlands predominate, wetlands
     smaller than 3 acres may not be mapped. Thus, a detailed on-the-ground and historical analysis of a single
     site may result in a revision of the wetland boundaries established through photographic interpretation. In
     addition, some small wetlands and those obscured by dense forest cover may not be included in this
     dataset.

     Process Step

     Process Description: NWI maps are compiled through manual photointerpretation of NHAP or
     NAPP aerial photography, supplemented by soil surveys and field checking of wetland
     photo signatures. Delineated wetland boundaries are manually transferred from
     interpreted photos to USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps and then manually
     labeled. Quality control steps occur throughout the photointerpretation, map compilation,
     and map reproduction processes.

     Process Description: Digital wetlands data were manually digitized from stable-base copies of the
     1:24,000 scale wetlands overlays registered to the standard U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
     7.5 minute quadrangles into topologically correct data files using Wetlands Analytical
     Mapping System (WAMS) software. Files contain ground planimetric coordinates and
     wetland attributes. The quadrangles were referenced to the North American Datum of
     1927 (NAD27) horizontal datum. Manual digitizing used a digitizing table to capture the
     digital data at a resolution of at least 0.005 inches; attribution was performed as the data
     were digitized. The data were checked for position by comparing plots of the digital data
     to the source material.

     Detailed Description

     Entity Type
     Entity Type Label: wetland
     Entity Type Definition: Wetlands are lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems
     where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow
     water. For purposes of this classification wetlands must have one or more of the
     following three attributes: 1) at least periodically, the land supports predominantly
     hydrophytes; 2) the substrate is predominantly undrained hydric soil; and 3) the substrate
     is non-soil and is saturated with water or covered by shallow water at some time during
     the growing season of each year.

     Attribute
     Attribute label: wetland classification
     Attribute Definition: The wetland classification system is hierarchical, with wetlands and
     deepwater habitats divided among five major systems at the broadest level. The five
     systems include Marine (open ocean and associated coastline), Estuarine (salt marshes
     and brackish tidal water), Riverine (rivers, creeks, and streams), Lacustrine (lakes and deep
     ponds), and Palustrine (shallow ponds, marshes, swamps, sloughs). Systems are further
     subdivided into subsystems which reflect hydrologic conditions. Below the subsystem is
     the class which describes the appearance of the wetland in terms of vegetation or
     substrate. Each class is further subdivided into subclasses; vegetated subclasses are
     described in terms of life form and substrate subclasses in terms of composition. The
     classification system also includes modifiers to describe hydrology (water regime), soils,
     water chemistry (pH, salinity), and special modifiers relating to man's activities (e.g.,
     impounded, partly drained).

     Glossary
     [Most of the terms and definitions are from Department of Commerce, 1992, Spatial Data Transfer Standard
     (SDTS) (Federal Information Processing Standard 173): Washington: Department of Commerce, National
     Institute of Standards and Technology.]
     abscissa -- the coordinate of a point in a plane cartesian coordinate system obtained by measuring parallel to the

     accepted as being true.
     altitude -- elevation above or below a reference datum, as defined in Federal Information Processing Standard 70-1.
     See also elevation.
     area -- a generic term for a bounded, continuous, two-dimensional object that may or may not include its boundary.
     area chain -- a chain that explicitly references left and right polygons and not start and end nodes. It is a component

     chain -- a directed nonbranching sequence of nonintersecting line segments and (or) arcs bounded by nodes, not
     necessarily distinct, at each end. Area chain, complete chain, and network chain are special cases of chain,
     and share all characteristics of the general case as defined above.
     clearinghouse -- see National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse.
     complete chain -- a chain that explicitly references left and right polygons and start and end nodes. It is a component
     of a two-dimensional manifold.
     compound element -- a group of data elements and other compound elements. Compound elements represent
     higher-level concepts that cannot be represented by individual data elements.
     coordinates -- pairs of numbers expressing horizontal distances along orthogonal axes; alternatively, triplets of
     numbers measuring horizontal and vertical distances.
     data element -- a logically primitive item of data.
     data set -- a collection of related data.
     depth -- perpendicular distance of an interior point from the surface of an object.
     developable surface -- a surface that can be flattened to form a plane without compressing or stretching any part of it.
      Examples include cones and cylinders.
     digital image -- a two-dimensional array of regularly spaced picture elements (pixels) constituting a picture.
     digital volume -- a three-dimensional array of regularly spaced volume elements (voxels) constituting a volume.
     domain -- in the definition of the elements in the metadata standard, the domain identifies valid values for a
     data element.

     Edge, Topology Level 0 -- VPF term for a string.
     Edge, Topology Level 1 -- VPF term for a network chain in a network (in SDTS, a "Network chain, non-planar graph").
     Edge, Topology Level 2 -- VPF term for a network chain in a planar graph (in SDTS, a "Network chain, planar graph").
     Edge, Topology Level 3 -- VPF term for a complete chain.
     elevation -- conforming to Federal Information Processing Standard 70-1, the term "altitude" is used in this standard,
     rather than the common term elevation.
     entity instance -- a spatial phenomenon of a defined type that is embedded in one or more phenomena of different
     type, or that has at least one key attribute value different from the corresponding attribute values of
     surrounding phenomena (e.g., the 10 Street Bridge).
     entity point -- a point used for identifying the location of point features (or areal features collapsed to a point), such
     as towers, buoys, buildings, places, etc.
     entity type -- the definition and description of a set into which similar entity instances are classified (e.g., bridge).
     explicit -- method of identifying positions directly by pairs (for horizontal positions) or triplets (for horizontal and
     vertical positions) of numbers.
     Face, Topology Level 3 -- VPF term for a GT-polygon composed of rings.
     G-polygon -- an area consisting of an interior area, one outer G-ring and zero or more nonintersecting, nonnested
     inner G-rings. No ring, inner or outer, shall be collinear with or intersect any other ring of the same
     G-polygon.
     G-ring -- a ring created from strings and (or) arcs.
     geospatial data -- information that identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed
     features and boundaries on the earth. This information may be derived from, among other things, remote
     sensing, mapping, and surveying technologies.
     graph -- a set of topologically interrelated zero-dimensional (node), one-dimensional (link or chain), and some-times
     two-dimensional (GT-polygon) objects that conform to a set of defined constraint rules. Numerous rule sets
     can be used to distinguish different types of graphs. Three such types, planar graph, network, and
     two-dimensional manifold, are used in this standard. All three share the following rules: each link or chain is
     bounded by an ordered pair of nodes, not necessarily distinct; a node may bound one or more links or
     chains; and links or chains may only intersect at nodes. Planar graphs and networks are two specialized
     types of graphs, and a two-dimensional manifold is an even more specific type of planar graph.
     grid -- (1) a set of grid cells forming a regular, or nearly regular, tessellation of a surface; (2) a set of points arrayed in
     a pattern that forms a regular, or nearly regular, tesselation of a surface. The tessellation is regular if formed
     by repeating the pattern of a regular polygon, such as a square, equilateral triangle, or regular hexagon. The
     tessellation is nearly regular if formed by repeating the pattern of an "almost" regular polygon such as a
     rectangle, non-square parallelogram, or non-equilateral triangle.
     grid cell -- a two-dimensional object that represents the smallest nondivisible element of a grid.
     GT-polygon -- an area that is an atomic two-dimensional component of one and only one two-dimensional manifold.
     The boundary of a GT-polygon may be defined by GT-rings created from its bounding chains. A
     GT-polygon may also be associated with its chains (either the bounding set, or the complete set) by direct
     reference to these chains. The complete set of chains associated with a GT-polygon may also be found by
     examining the polygon references on the chains.

     GT-ring -- a ring created from complete and (or) area chains.
     horizontal -- tangent to the geoid or parallel to a plane that is tangent to the geoid.
     implicit -- method of identifying positions by a place in an array of values.
     interior area -- an area not including its boundary.
     label point -- a reference point used for displaying map and chart text (e.g., feature names) to assist in feature
     identification.
     latitude -- angular distance measured on a meridian north or south from the equator.
     layer -- an integrated, areally distributed, set of spatial data usually representing entity instances within one theme, or
     having one common attribute or attribute value in an association of spatial objects. In the context of raster
     data, a layer is specifically a two-dimensional array of scaler values associated with all of part of a grid or
     image.
     line -- a generic term for a one-dimensional object.
     line segment -- a direct line between two points.
     link -- a topological connection between two nodes. A link may be directed by ordering its nodes.
     longitude -- angular distance between the plane of a meridian east or west from the plane of the meridian of
     Greenwich.
     map -- a spatial representation, usually graphic on a flat surface, of spatial phenomena.
     media -- the physical devices used to record, store, and (or) transmit data.
     meridian -- a great circle on the Earth that passes through the geographic poles.
     metadata -- data about the content, quality, condition, and other characteristics of data.
     National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse -- a distributed network of geospatial data producers, managers, and users
     linked electronically. Building on initiatives such as the national information infrastructure, the
     clearinghouse uses a distributed, electronically connected network, such as the Internet. Each data provider
     will describe available data in an electronic form, and provide these descriptions (or "metadata") using
     means that can be accessed over a communications network. Thus, the data for the clearinghouse are
     located at the sites of data producers (or, where more efficient, at the sites of intermediaries) throughout the
     country. Using the network, users will search these descriptions to locate data that are suitable for their
     applications.
     network -- a graph without two dimensional objects. If projected onto a two-dimensional surface, a network can have
     either more than one node at a point and (or) intersecting links or chains without corresponding nodes.
     network chain -- a chain that explicitly references start and end nodes and not left and right polygons. It is a
     component of a network.
     node -- a zero-dimensional object that is a topological junction of two or more links or chains, or an end point of a link
     or chain.
     Node, Topology Level 0 -- VPF term for a point (in SDTS, a "point").
     Node, Topology Level 1 -- VPF term for a node on a network (in SDTS, a "node, network").

     Node, Topology Level 2 -- VPF term for a node on a planar graph (in SDTS, a "node, planar graph").
     Node, Topology Level 3 -- VPF term for a point used to represent isolated features. These are topologically linked to
     a containing face.
     object -- a digital representation of all or part of an entity instance.
     ordinate -- the coordinate of a point in a plane cartesian coordinate system obtained by measuring parallel to the
     y-axis ("the 'y' value").
     phenomenon -- a fact, occurrence or circumstance. Route 10, George Washington National Forest, and Chesterfield
     County are all phenomena.
     pixel -- two-dimensional picture element that is the smallest nondivisible element of a digital image.
     planar graph -- the node and link or chain objects of the graph occur or can be represented as though they occur
     upon a planar surface. Not more than one node may exist at any given point on the surface. Links or chains
     may only intersect at nodes.
     point -- a zero-dimensional object that specifies geometric location. One coordinate pair or triplet specifies the
     location. Area point, entity point, and label point are special implementations of the general case.
     primitive -- the quality of not being subdivided; atomic.
     quality -- an essential or distinguishing characteristic necessary for cartographic data to be fit for use.
     raster -- one or more overlapping layers for the same grid or digital image.
     raster object - one or more images and/or grids, each grid or image representing a layer, such that corresponding grid
     cells and/or pixels between layers are congruent and registered.
     resolution -- the minimum difference between two independently measured or computed values which can be
     distinguished by the measurement or analytical method being considered or used.
     ring -- sequence of nonintersecting chains or strings and (or) arcs, with closure. A ring represents a closed
     boundary, but not the interior area inside the closed boundary.
     SDTS -- the Spatial Data Transfer Standard defined by Department of Commerce, 1992, Spatial Data Transfer Standard
     (SDTS) (Federal Information Processing Standard 173): Washington, Department of Commerce, National
     Institute of Standards and Technology.
     spatial data -- see geospatial data.
     stratum -- one of a series of layers, levels, or gradations in an ordered system. For this standard, the term is used in
     the sense of (1) a region of sea, atmosphere, or geology that is distinguished by natural or arbitrary limits;
     (2) a socioeconomic level of society comprised of persons of the same or similar status, especially with
     regard to education or culture; or (3) a layer of vegetation, usually of the same or similar height.
     string -- a connected nonbranching sequence of line segments specified as the ordered sequence of points between
     those line segments. Note: A string may intersect itself or other strings.
     two-dimensional manifold -- a planar graph and its associated two dimensional objects. Each chain bounds two and
     only two, not necessarily distinct, GT-polygons. The GT-polygons are mutually exclusive and completely
     exhaust the surface.
     type -- in the definition of the elements in the metadata standard, a compound element has the type "compound" to
     provide a unique way to identify compound elements. For a data element, the type identifies the kind of
     value that can be assigned to the data element. The choices are "integer" for integer numbers, "real" for real 

     numbers, "text" for ASCII characters, "date" for day of the year, and "time" for time of the day.
     universe polygon -- defines the part of the universe that is outside the perimeter of the area covered by other
     GT-polygons ("covered area") and completes the two-dimensional manifold. This polygon completes the
     adjacency relationships of the perimeter links. The boundary of the universe polygon is represented by one
     or more inner rings and no outer ring. Attribution of the universe polygon may not exist, or may be
     substantially different from the attribution of the covered area.
     vector -- composed of directed lines.
     vertical -- at right angles to the horizontal; includes altitude and depth.
     VPF -- the Vector Product Format defined by Department of Defense, 1992, Vector Product Format (MIL-STD-600006):
      Philadelphia, Department of Defense, Defense Printing Service Detachment Office.
     void polygon -- defines a part of the two-dimensional manifold that is bounded by other GT-polygons, but otherwise
     has the same characteristics as the universe polygon. The geometry and topology of a void polygon are
     those of a GT-polygon. Attribution of a void polygon may not exist, or may be substantially different from
     the attribution of the covered area.
     voxel -- a three-dimensional element that is the smallest nondivisible element of a digital volume.
