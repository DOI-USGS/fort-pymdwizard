      "\t\tTaskTitle Brown Treesnake Research Strategies\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The Brown Treesnakes colonization of Guam has resulted in the loss of at least 17 vertebrates from the island over the last 4 decades, but the unprecedented high populations of the snake contribute to further dispersal to other islands where similar ecological perturbations are likely. Studies of the vertebrate fauna of Guam in the context of an introduced predator and comparable faunas and habitats on other islands which have not yet been altered by the snake are important to guiding management actions by several federal and local agencies.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Work begun in FY01 will continue on the control of low density populations.  A trapping experiment was conducted in southern Guam to determine how prey density populations influence brown treesnake trapping (2002-03).  Results of this experiment have implications to controlling incipient populations of brown treesnakes on other islands where prey and rodent densities are high and snake populations are low.Trapping strategies and small snake capture:  1)enhancing operational trapping by refining knowledge of snake movement vis--vis traps, and 2) tests of small snake traps.  Control of low density populations: In addition, there is the problem of simply having too few snakes in a small population to assure detection of the population.  We expect to pursue two approaches to this problem: 1) locally reducing rodent populations to enhance trap capture, and 2) testing of trap results in areas of Munitions Storage Area where snake density has been reduced by intensive operational trapping.  Physiological studies in support of interdiction and control  1) studies of critical thermal thresholds as they pertain to accidental interisland transport of BTS, and 2) studies of thyroid function and shedding as a potential control approach. While some progress has been made in FY2001 on identifying the critical temperatures that must be maintained in a cargo container to insure the death of Brown Treesnake stowaways, animal welfare requirements in the preliminary runs dictated the use of anesthesia during the temperature testing.  Several lines of evidence suggest that this interfered with accurate measurement of the critical threshold that would apply to temperatures experienced by anaesthetized snakes.  Toxicant development  As in the recent past, there is a need for promoting the continuous development of Brown Treesnake toxicants, primarily through support of the excellent work being done at the National Wildlife Research Center (USDA). In cooperation with NWRC, research has been conducted on chemical control methods, toxicants, fumigants, and delivery techniques.  Ongoing research into the venom of the Brown Treesnake (Steve Mackessy, Univ. of Northern Colorado) has provided considerable insight into the biochemical components of the venom and the health effects and treatments associated with these complex compounds.  This valued work can be supported for a very modest investment. In late FY01 we circulated a proposal for a rapid response team, to assist islands in the detection, delineation, and control of incipient Brown Treesnake populations.  The crux of this proposal was a shift in primary reliance from snake trapping to visual searching.  This shift was recommended on the basis of our analysis of the effects of prey abundance on the effectiveness of operational snake traps. The Rapid Response Team has been deployed routinely since its formation in 2001, and continues to provide response to snake sightings. In 2004 we began training a canine team to detect the presence of snakes to assist the Rapid Response Team.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Invasive Species Program Goals # 2 and # 4 - 2 - Early Detection & Rapid Response -  Identify and report new invasions and assess risks to natural areas and waters.4 - Control  Provide approaches to contain, reduce, and eliminate populations of invasive species and restore habitats and native species.The objectives are to expand biological understanding of the brown treesnake with special emphasis on reproduction, recruitment, maturation, and movements.1 -  Conduct lab and field experiments on sensory biology (test olfactory and visual cues) with the aim to develop artificial attractants, baits, and capture aids to develop a more effective and efficient control program for snakes on Guam.2 - Research demographic apsects of snake populations to  determine detectability of snakes, trapability of snakes,individual growth and survivorship in order to develop a more effective and efficent control program for snakes on Guam.3 -  Test and investigate new and existing snake barrier designs, and develop potentially new control strategies for low density populations of snakes recently established in the CNMI. 4 - Continue experimental monitoring and demonstration of feasibility of barriers as control tools in the protection of endangered species from predation by snakes, preventing snakes from entering the transportation network, and use of barriers and other control strategies in situations where snakes are sighted on nearby snake-free islands. 5 - Test the physiological tolerance limits (temperature and moisture) of brown treesnakes in order to apply to controlling snake populatins from entering or surviving the transportation pathways.6- Test feasibility and efficacy of trained detector dogs as a method of finding snakes, ultimately for use in conjunction with human searchers (Rapid Response Team).7- Determine the abundance and distribution of introduced rodents and shrews on Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)in order to further evaluate the relationship between Brown Treesnake trap capture rates and rodent/shrew populations.The ecological effects attributable to introduced populations of brown treesnakes on Guam and other islands are complex, spill down to many aspects of the terrestrial island ecosystem, and justify expanded efforts to reduce the problems. This effort will attempt to compile the scientific data necessary to guide management efforts to control exotic species and contain their spread.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings DEMOGRAPHY STUDY: The first year (June 2004  May 2005) of formal sampling for the Closed Population Project has proven to be a success.  The first trapping session included 101 occasions of mark-release-recapture sampling.  With 169 traps in operation that amounted to 17,069 trap nights.  This was followed by a session of intensive visual searches that involved 109 night-time searches and continued mark-release-recapture sampling.  At the end of these combined efforts we are confident we have a complete census of the geographically closed population and complete baseline information.  In addition to knowing the capture histories of every snake in the population, we also gathered repeated morphological measurements on each snake over time.  Baseline habitat data were also collected in the form of vegetation sampling and systematic photographic documentation.  These data are providing valuable inferences regarding trappability and its relationships to individual attributes (size, gender, condition, etc.) as well as demographic rates (birth, survival, maturation, etc.) in this BTS population.  Three publications based on the first year of data are currently in preparation or internal review.In June-July of 2005 we conducted the second trapping session, which consisted of 50 trapping occasions on the same array.  This continued monitoring of the snake population was combined with a field test of trap modification using visual guides on the trap entrance cone.  This modification was intended to aid snakes in locating the trap entrance by the addition of radial linear strips around the entrance, an opaque covering around the trap entrance, or both.  Preliminary analyses found no differences in capture rates for any trap modification.  The ongoing observations of the population, however, continue to provide further trappability and demographic information as well.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments DEMOGRAPHY STUDY: 100 nights of trapping and visual searches (mark-recapture sampling) at the 5-ha closed population enclosure at Andersen AFB have yielded data that are currently being analyzed using advanced capture/recapture modelling.PREY DENSITY: In 2003 small snake trappability was estimated with reference to trap attractant and abundance of a common introduced skink (Carlia ailanpalai) at two sites on northern Guam.  In 2002-2003 the effect of rodent density on snake trappability was studied on four sites in Southern Guam. As of April 2005, rodents and shrews are being systematically monitored by a mammalogist on Guam and the CNMI.CANINE TEAM: Two dogs and their handlers completed preliminary training in Montana in late 2004, and are currently on Guam being trained to detect the presence of snakes in jungle, forest and grassland. TRAP DESIGN: A study is currently being conducted to test the effectiveness of visual guides on trap flaps as a way to lure a snake into the trap. BARRIERS: In 2004 and 2005, a test of Wondertek, a barrier material, was/is being conducted. Wondertek offers more portability to a contruction site and reduced cost versus concrete barriers. The test involves infrared camera monitoring of snakes attempting to breach the barrier. At this time, video footage is being analyzed.THERMAL TOLERANCES STUDY: The use of elevated temperatures as a non-toxic alternative to chemical fumigation has long been recognized as an effective strategy for invertebrate pest management associated with food production and processing facilities. Manipulating temperature in cargo holds and containers may be a useful tool in the reduction or elimination of B. irregularis invasions. The aim of our study is the determination of the upper (TUL) and lower (TLL) lethal temperatures of B. irregularis and to establish whether these temperatures fall within the practically attainable values in shipping containers, aircraft cargo holds and aircraft wheel wells.  In order to achieve this objective, we propose to expose live and unanesthetized B. irregularis to various temperatures for a set time period in a controlled environment. At this time (25 Aug 2005) the actual thermal chamber on Guam is operational. Preliminary tests are concluding and the study should begin in earnest 1 September 2005.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle NRPP Willow Persistence in Yellowstone National Park: Interactive Effects of Climate, Hydrology and Herbivory\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Wyoming, has experienced a warmer, drier climate since the turn of the century. Increasing warmth and decreasing precipitation may have simultaneously contributed to an expansion in elk winter range, a large decline in beaver populations, and a decline in the extent of riparian communities dominated by willows (Salix spp.). During this same period, management of wildlife in YNP was revised to adhere with the concept of natural regulation, and managers are thus concerned that a possible overabundance of elk may be responsible for the decline in riparian shrubs. Because climate change coincided with increased abundance of elk on the northern range and a decline in beaver, evidence to evaluate the roles of these factors on riparian shrubs is equivocal and the subject of intense debate.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology To reconstruct local stream flow over this period we collected tree cores from ~150 Douglas Firs in the watersheds of the study streams.  The variation in annual ring width will be used to create an index of precipitation.  This precipitation index will be correlated to discharge and used to reconstruct historical stream flow. To determine whether beavers have been actively manipulating small northern range streams for many hundreds of years, we will analyze the stratigraphy of floodplain sediments to identify likely beaver pond deposits.  Plant responses measured include height, current annual growth (CAG), mortality, and pre-dawn water potentials, which is a measure of plant water stress.  In addition, all tagged stems outside of exclosures were measured in May of 2002 to quantify browsing intensity from the previous winter.  At each plot, 7 plants of each species were chosen and three rooted stems, were chosen on each plant. These were tagged and measured in August or September of 2001 and 2002 for CAG, current perpendicular height, and perpendicular height to the previous years growth.  CAG was assessed on each stem by counting the number of new, current year shoots, and measuring the length of 6 or 10% of the shoots, chosen systematically, whichever number was greater.  30 off-plot samples of current year shoots of each species on each watershed were cut, measured for length, dried, and weighed in order to form a regression to predict shoot dry weight from length.  The isotopic analysis will be performed on 10 plant clumps from each plot at Elk Creek.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources, Goal 4 - Develop restoration strategies on Federal lands and critical environments.The proposed research will evaluate the causes of decline in riparian shrubs by evaluating the importance of beaver activities on key ecosystem attributes and processes, conducting experiments to determine biotic and abiotic controls on production and establishment of riparian shrubs, and integrating existing information to historic and future ecosystem responses to climate and management scenarios. To do so, we plan to assess heights of water tables and water sources of willows in sites occupied and abandoned by beaver, and conduct experiments to evaluate responses of willows to water availability, elk populations nutrients, and herbivory. Objectives include:1) Determine the influence of hydrology, herbivory, and their interaction on growth and persistence of willow 2) Evaluate the role of disturbance by beaver in controlling spatial variation in hydrology and nutrient dynamics necessary to sustain willow communities. 3) Analyze trends in willow abundance and trends using GIS and ground truthing.4) Evaluate history of disturbance by beaver and its relationship to the distribution of willow at local and landscape scales and 5) In collaboration with stakeholders and managers, modify contemporary ecosystem models to evaluate management alternatives for reversing current trajectories in the abundance and distribution of willow.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan This research will allow us to present managers with forecasts of the effects of climate change on riparian shrub communities, elk distribution, beavers, and the potential cascading effects on elk-wolf dynamics. We will evaluate specific prescriptions for management of willows. By so doing, this research will support decisions on management of riparian communities in the face of climate change, and identify key ecosystem variables driving changes in riparian plant and animal communities in YNP.Funding for this task ended in FY2004.  Products based on FY2004 contracts with CSU from this task will be completed in FY2005.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings There has been relatively continuous willow establishment at our study sites over the past 80 years, and there are a large number of willows that established in the 1920-30s, a climatically diverse period that had large beaver populations in the northern range.  Interestingly, a significant number of willows established in 1989, following the fires of 1988.  The establishment ages indicate that between the 1920s and 1989 there was low, but continuous willow recruitment at most sites.  This time span of slow but steady recruitment does not appear to be associated with hydrologic events or other specific disturbances, such as fire.  After ~1970, most willows established <1 m above the current channel, with the exception of the 1989 cohort, which established across a wide range of heights.  This may be evidence for a period of downcutting, initiating around 1970, because willows that established prior to 1970 are between 0 and 2.5m above the current channel and most willows established since 1970 are < 1 m above the current channel.  Analysis of pre-treatment, 2001 data reveals that 28% and 7%of the variation in CAG for S. bebbiana and S. geyeriana, respectively, is explained by naturally occurring variation in water table depth.  This suggests that there is water limitation in at least these two species. Our preliminary results support the notion that capacity for growth in willows may be more constrained by water availability than level of herbivory in the previous winter.  This result is counterintuitive upon viewing the plants, because the plants inside the exclosures are certainly taller and have more biomass than those outside, since they were not browsed back the previous winter.  However, the amount the plants grew in the summer of 2002 was not significantly different.Analysis of 2002 data is currently in progress. Results so far are as follows:Preliminary results from the willow establishment ages are not correlated with the hypothesized climate and beaver-induced hydrologic changes that occurred during the 20th century. There has been relatively continuous willow establishment at our study sites over the past 80 years, and there are a large number of willows that established in the 1920-30's, a climatically diverse period that had large beaver populations in the northern range. Further spatial and statistical analysis will determine if this correlation between beaver abandonment and willow establishment in the 1920-30's is significant.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Wild horse populations increase at a constant high rate on U.S. western rangelands, creating a management challenge for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Department of Interior. The U.S. Geological Survey has the unique capability not only to gather much of the essential data and to conduct valuable, long-term research for the BLM, but also to engage specialists from other agencies and institutions for the purpose of developing interdisciplinary teams to generate the high-quality findings needed for informed, science-based management decisions by the BLM.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology \n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife, #1 - Provide the Scientific Foundation for the Conservation of Terrestrial Plants, Wildlife, and Habitats by developing the basic biological information that partners need to formulate adaptive management strategies.In 2001, the USGS-BRD was assigned the task of coordinating peer input into 5 key management topics (fertility control, genetic conservation, habitat assessments and setting population goal, health and handling issues) and in assisting the BLM in developing a long-range research strategic plan. The strategic planning process centered around 4 goals: (1) review past progress and identify problems; (2) set broad goals central to the BLMs mission for wild horse and burro management; (3) establish specific, time-bound measurable goals and strategies to achieve those goals; (4) evaluate progress at set time periods and readjust the planning as needed. Fertility Control:  Contraceptive research to slow the fertility rates of overabundant wildlife is a highly active and rapidly evolving field. The fertility control committee was presented with a broad array of antifertility agents and devices whose effects on fertility vary greatly in their basic functions. Many of the agents are completely unrelated in their primary purpose, their mode of blocking fertility, and in their application. Much of the research findings are brand new, not yet published, and not yet tested. While an exciting field of research, these are new, but sometimes not fully tested and sometimes conflicting reports of success. This situation presented the committee, and thus the BLM, with a bewildering array of options and approaches to select for fertility control research. Some of the the fertility control committee's conclusions were: (1) The committee unanimously supports the BLMs stated need and requirements for fertility control in the wild horse herds. They also felt that the justification for fertility control is primarily based on humane issues at this time. Fertility control would permit fewer individual horses to be chased, rounded up, removed from the range, and adopted. Although the public eagerly adopts many animals, the adoption process is often oversaturated with animals, and many of the older animals prove to be unadoptable and are held in facilities for many years. The adoption process is more successful when fewer animals enter the program. Fertility control could also focus on the oldest mares whose genetic contribution to the population has already occurred and whose individual longevity will be increased by the antifertility application. Initially, some of the treated mares may need to be handled, or remotely darted more frequently. However, the BLMs ultimate goal is to increase the interval between gathers and to reduce costs, although those goals may take a few years to achieve. (2)The committee also concluded that fertility control could assist the BLM in the management process and reduce the number of animals to be adopted, but that fertility control would never completely replace the adoption process. (3) Wild horses, not burros, should be the primary initial focus for fertility control. The lack of a distinct breeding season and any harem structure does not make burros as amenable to fertility control applications. Fertility control in burros should be pursued, but after an agent is developed for wild horses.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle NRPP 99-05 Restoration of Native Ungulates into Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area and Minimization of Conflicts with Wild Horses\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The Wild Horse and Burro Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-195) provided protection for all wild horses on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands, and also to some animals on National Park Service and National Forest land. At the time of the Act, perhaps 17,000 wild horses lived on public lands. The Bureau of Land Management was not prepared to monitor or manage that number of wild horses, and many herds went unmanaged for years. The significant natural predators of the only recent native wild horses (e.g. the Mongolian horse of Europe and Asia (Equus przewalski) and the Tarpan horse of Europe) included wolves, brown bears, and tigers. None of these predators currently exist on any of the wild horse ranges in the western United States and survival rates of wild horses are very high. In many cases 95-97% of horses survive each year. Many horse herds grow at phenomenal annual rates of 15-22%. By 1980, there were between 65,000 and 80,000 wild horses on these same public lands. Management was instituted in most herds, typically through helicopter round-ups and adoption of the excess animals. But, prior to management, many wild horse ranges were over-grazed by cattle and horses, and some horses starved to death or died of dehydration. In terms of the bighorn sheep population in the area, managers are concerned about the declining bighorn population for the following reasons: 1.) Lamb-to-ewe ratios and population estimates plummeted in 1995 and 1996, at a time of all-time high numbers in wild horses on the DryHead subpopulation. This is the area supporting most of the bighorn population. 2.) The preliminary simulation modeling of Coughenour (1997 presentation and in prep.) suggests lowered body condition and lowered population growth of bighorn sheep when wild horse numbers are approximately double the allowable number. Because wild horses are reduced to the allowable number only every two-three years, and since the wild horse herd increases at an average rate of 18% per year, in most years horse numbers are well above (18-54%) the allowable number. 3.) The area of greatest concentration of wild horses during winter is in the Big Coulee area, especially the low elevation, exposed knife-like ridges and steep slopes to the east of Big Coulee. This relatively snow-free area has been mapped by a GIS-based habitat model as suitable bighorn sheep winter range, but bighorn sheep are never, or only occasionally observed here. But similar steep canyon habitat to the west and just outside of the wild horse range in Crooked Creek canyon has recently been colonized successfully by a small group of bighorn sheep lambs and ewes (Kissell et al. 1996). We stress that these observations do not imply any negative cause and effect relationships of wild horses upon bighorn sheep. At this time, they are merely interesting correlations and observations. The purpose of the proposed research is to determine if there are any real conflicts between wild horses and bighorn sheep by gathering more intense information on both species, comparing between areas of overlap and areas of no overlap.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Using Student Conservation Association volunteers, we will continue to monitor the bighorn sheep population for mortalitites using the existing mortality collars and all mortalitites will be investigated.We will also conduct 2 aerial surveys -- one helicopter and one fixed-wing survey to estimate current population size and survey the sheep locations.  The NPS will pay for these surveys.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources, Goal 4 - Develop restoration strategies on Federal lands and critical environments.Objectives:1.  Evaluate current disease problems and mortality rates in bighorn sheep through captures and follow-up studies.2.  Determine the wintering spatial relations of wild horses, bighorn sheep and mule deer through aerial surveys of the entire winter range conducted each winter.3.  Determine why bighorn sheep are not using what has been mapped with a GIS-based habitat model as suitable bighorn sheep habitat in areas with high wintering densities of wild horses.  Sample winter consumption rates of vegetation, snow depths, and key forages to see if there are other reasons precluding use of these areas by bighorn sheep.  4.  Compare winter body condition, lamb recruitment rates, and total vegetation consumption rates on bighorn sheep winter use areas with: (a) wild horses present, (b) no wild horses present.5.  Conduct GIS-based assessments of the feasibility of reintroducing elk and pronghorn antelope to the area.  Assess common forages, winter snow depths, habitat preferences of the two species matched against current wild horse distribution patterns (based upon the aerial surveys) and predict any areas of potential conflict.   6.  Produce year-round GIS-base distribution maps for wild horse and winter-use areas for bighorn sheep.  Identify any areas receiving no use.  Sample those areas for suitability.   The purpose of the proposed research is to determine if there are any real conflicts between wild horses and bighorn sheep by gathering more intense animal condition information on both species compared between areas of overlap and areas of no overlap.  We also propose to study ungulate use of several small experimental burns, and two experimental water holes  to see if both species can be encouraged to use areas of the range that they are currently not using.The hypotheses we plan to investigate are:1.  Bighorn sheep are declining because of the presence of a pathogen which is reducing survivorship, particularly of lambs.2. Some other source of mortality, such as a localized increase in mountain lion predation, is reducing survivorship.3.  Bighorn sheep are in better body condition in situations where they do not share ranges with wild horses.4.  Wild horse body condition changes as densities of horses increase 36-58% over the course of the study period (until the next gather and removal).5.  Well-positioned prescribed burns can be used to increase bighorn sheep and wild horse use of currently little-used areas and can be used to encourage separation of the two species.6.  Well-positioned water holes can be used to encourage wild horses to inhabit little-used areas that are not suitable bighorn sheep habitat, to reduce wild horse concentrations, and to encourage separation between the two species.  Improvement of a trail across a steep canyon that has not been used since 1994 (when presumably the peripheral horses that used the trail were removed) will encourage use of several hundred acres of winter range that is currently not used.  This area is not bighorn sheep habitat.\n",

Managers need additional information on elk-woody browse relations in the Jackson Balley to guide their management decisions.  The elk and bison winter ranges in the Jackson Valley lie on a land complex consisting of Grand Teton NP (GTNP), National Elk Refuge (NER), town of Jackson, private ranches, and private housing developments.  To reduce conflicts on these private lands, elk and bison are artifically fed afalfa pellets at several feed grounds located on the National Elk Refuge, the Gros Bentre Valley (Bridger-Teton NF) , and south of the town. The concentrations of elk may be altering vegetation communities, especially riparian willow, aspen, buffalo berry, and other woody shrubs near the feed grounds.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Effects of Ungulates on Nitrogen Availability\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Recently there are concerns over the potential overabundance and/or overconcentration of elk and bison populations in many locales of the western United States and Canadian provinces. he elimination of large, capable predators, disruption of migration routes, and the creation of artificial forage areas in towns have contributed to these possible overconcentrations. Nowhere is this statement more true than in the Jackson Hole area including the National Elk Refuge (NER) and Grand Teton National Park (GTNP) in the Jackson Hole Valley, Wyoming. Disruption of ungulates includes the abbreviation or elimination of historic migrations to distant winter ranges and the placement of the town of Jackson on former winter range. Elk and bison are fed as mitigation for the loss of habitat and as a method to concentrate the animals in areas away from private lands where they might have conflicts with domestic cattle, fencing, hay stacks, and human housing. Approximately three-quarters of the Jackson elk herd and all but about 20 bison from the Jackson herd are fed each winter. The management agencies responsible for elk management in the Jackson Valley are currently revising their elk management plans. Parallel efforts are underway by the U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in concert with the National Park Service, while the State of Wyoming Game and Fish Department is also reviewing and revising their elk management plan. The federal efforts will involve a series of public meetings, public input and a formal Environmental Impact Statement. We propose to apply a set of alternative criteria to the question of the most appropriate grazing effects for ungulates in the Jackson Valley.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology \n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: Model factors controlling ecosystem patterns at various scales and develop decision support systems which integrate this information with management options.We propose to apply the Grazing Sustainability Approach that emphasizes effects of ungulates on the ecosystems nutrient pools (both short-term and long-term), the effects of ungulates on fluxes of nutrients, effects on ecosystem processes, and any effects on the long-term sustainable plant production of the system. We will emphasize the effects of ungulates on the nitrogen cycle and their effects on the availability of carbon and other associated macronutrients to plants in the ecosystem. We emphasize the study of nitrogen, since it is an essential nutrient that may drive the productivity level of temperate ecosystems. Ecosystem nitrogen pools may take centuries to accumulate and turnover rates of some nitrogen pools may be slow. Thus, losses of nitrogen pools may take decades or longer to recover. Any large change in nitrogen availability, either a decrease or an increase, can potentially alter not only the potential plant productivity of a site, but also the composition of plant species that the site can support since many plants have a narrow range of nitrogen availability where they are most competitive. Organic matter content of the soil is also tied to nitrogen availability, and soil organic matter is essential to water retention capabilities of the soil. The objectives of this study are:1. To determine if nitrogen is limiting to National Elk Refuge (NER), Grand Teton NP (GTNP) or Teton National Forest (TNF) ungulate winter ranges.2. To determine if artificial feeding of elk and bison on the National Elk Refuge results in a nitrogen enrichment of the sites. If enrichment is occurring, to determine if this alters plant species compositions.3. To determine if the effect of ungulate grazing herbivory is altering nitrogen availability, either positive or negative. 4. To determine the long-term sustainability of the grazing system under current ungulate management and current levels of ungulate densities and rates of herbivory by ungulates.\n",

      "\t\tMethodology \n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: Model factors controlling ecosystem patterns at various scales and develop decision support systems which integrate this information with management options.The EIS scoping meeting in 2001 indicated to the management agencies that the public requires further scenarios using the ecosystem models developed by the NREL-USGS research team. The scenarios will be directly inserted into the public documents (EIS) and presented to the public as potential management alternatives. The purpose of this modification is to provide support to Colorado State University to model the additional scenarios.Elk and bison management in the Jackson Valley is a controversial topic. Elk and bison are artificially fed each winter on the National Elk Refuge. The feeding likely supports more elk and bison than would be supported naturally in the ecosystem. The feeding is publicly supported by the Wyoming Game and Fist Department, since the feeding reduces the numbers of elk and bison that might otherwise travel to ranches in the area and cause damage to haystacks. Unfortunately, concentrations of ungulates on the National Elk Refuge may promote the transmission of brucellosis within the elk and bison herds, and may cause the overuse of local forages. Management agencies seek novel or compromise management scenarios that minimize negative effects of elk and bison on vegetation, minimize disease transmission, and yet do not result in widespread depredations on local cattle ranches. Methods:1. Run the Forage Accounting Model on the entire TBISON study area with a limit on the amount of production that can be removed (70%) in a factorial design. Factors will include 3 levels of winter severity (average, above average, and severe), 3 levels of summer precipitation (dry, mean, and wet, where dry corresponds to summer 2001 measurements), 3 levels of bison numbers, and 6 levels of elk abundance.2. Run the Forage Accounting Model on the NER only with a limit on the amount of production that can be removed (70%) in a factorial design.

Conduct a validation exercise for the snow model. This validation will statistically compare observed versus predicted measurements for the 48 supplemental snow sites on the 9 days of measurement done by Phil Farnes. These days are Feb 1st, Mar 1st, and April 1st, in 1997, 1998, and 1999. 4. Run the Forage Accounting Model using a few relevant factors while restricting shrub use to 60% of shrub production.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Recovery of willow thickets on Yellowstone's northern winter range in apparent response to wolf restoration in 1995.\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Willow communities have declined dramatically over the past 80 years on Yellowstones northern winter range.  Estimates of this decline vary widely. The willows that are present are short and suppressed by browsing in many instances. The extent of height suppression varies with elevation across the northern winter range.  Short, suppressed willows are more prevalent at the warmer, lower elevations while tall willows are more prevalent at the higher elevations.  The NPS management of ungulates on Yellowstones northern range has resulted in one of the most controversial, even contentious, exchanges in the field of ecology over the past 80-90 years. Concerns over the potential overabundance of elk resulted in artificial reductions and removals of elk from the 1930s to 1968 that reduced the elk populations to <5,000 elk.  Since 1968, the park, however, instituted a natural regulation, or natural process regulation, of the elk population, and by 1988 the elk population had increased to a counted 19,000 animals.  Wolves were reintroduced in 1995 and have since increased to >75 animals on the northern range and 216 wolves total in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem.  Initial model experiments suggest the northern Yellowstone elk populations is about 15% smaller with wolves than would be predicted under the same climatic conditions and harvests in the absence of wolves.There are few specific guidelines for NPS managers as to what extent the structure of browsed shrub communities should be altered by wild, native ungulates.  We hypothesize that recovery of some aspen and willow patches in Yellowstone National Park is due more to changes in elk distributions following wolf recovery, than to numeric changes in elk numbers alone.  Park wolf biologists, local guides and hunters, and state elk biologists all report apparent changes in elk distributions following wolf restoration. Limited sampling of willows suggests a major change in elk herbivory on some (but not all) willow patches since about 1997.  Similar to aspen, rates of herbivory on some permanently-marked willow plots were much lower (15% less) when sampled post-wolf restoration in 2000 and 2002 than during 7 years of measurements sampled prior to wolf restoration in 1987-93.  At 3 of these marked willow patches, dramatic increases in the heights of the willows (3-4 fold increases) had occurred by 2000 and 2002, in concert with large increases in canopy cover of the willows, and in the tendency of large recovering willow plants to grow together.  By 2002, some willow plants, especially those near the core of willow patches, had substantially escaped the height of elk browsing (~180-200 cm).  True willow thickets, composed of tall, dense willows, and where elk cannot easily penetrate the center of the willow patch, were formed at some sites by 2002.  In addition to these transects, of 40 willow sites visited on the Northern Range in 2002, 38% were characterized as height released.  Willow height and cover release, however, is by no means ubiquitous to the entire northern range.  Thus, we hypothesize that the willow height releases and recovery of willow patches varies tremendously both spatially and temporally across the landscape.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Our study will take advantage of a natural experiment in the height release of willows on Yellowstones northern range. We will resample 16 permanently-marked willow transects in the post-wolf era (2005-2007) that were sampled seven years (1987-1993) pre-wolf. We will record and compare willow species, live heights and live diameters of the willows. Live annual biomass production of willows will be estimated from the numbers of rooted stems, numbers of shoots per rooted stem, shoot length, shoot diameters, and regressions of shoot parameters to shoot biomass following pre-wolf methodology of Singer et al. (1994). Production will be compared between pre- and post-wolf sample years. We will measure the lengths of leaders and annual height gains, 1997 to 2007, from leaf node scars on the terminal leaders of plants. We propose the additional sampling of all willow patches in five to seven drainages across the northern range. These drainages will be walked, and the perimeters of all willow and all other riparian shrub communities will be mapped using a GPS. Three circular 10m2 plots will be randomly located within each discrete patch, and willow community structure characteristics (average tallest heights, willow plant density, species composition)will be measured; as well as the characteristics of height release and characteristics of any thicket formation. The height release for willows may be a complex relationship possibly influenced by local elk densities, wolf activity in the area, wetness of the site, species of willows, snow pack at the site, and wetness (precipitation) in the years of release. We will develop multivariate models to evaluate the effects of these variables on browsing consumption levels and willow growth parameters using Akaikes Information Criteria to select the best explanatory multivariate model.We will update our earlier model exercise (Singer et al. 2003) to assess the influence that wolves are having on elk population sizes. We will determine the most current level of elk population limitation. Using our elk population model, we will project at what level of female elk harvest the elk population could stabilize under a variety of climate scenarios. The snowpack across Yellowstones northern winter range influences not only ungulate distributions that winter, but also influences soil moisture levels that contribute to plant growth during the subsequent growing season.  We will estimate SWE for the location of each ungulate group observed during the aerial surveys and for each willow sample location so that snowpack can be used in both analyses.The spatial patterns of the height release of willows across the northern winter range will be compared to winter elk densities estimated from the annual elk surveys.  The distribution patterns for wintering elk will be compared pre-wolf to post-wolf surveys.We will document the changes in ecosystem processes that may occur when height-suppressed willow patches are converted to tall, dense willow thickets.  We will locate six paired, naturally height-released patches and nearby suppressed patches and we will also sample 4 fenced and 4 browsed willow patches where the fences were erected in 2001.  We will sample litterfall using 10 litter boxes at each site, seed catkins will be counted each spring on 10 willow individuals at each site, and seed rain will be measured using 10 seed traps located at each site.We will sample the seasonal availability and soil leaching of inorganic N at each site with resin bags.  We will determine quantitative inorganic N pool sizes and net mineralization rates monthly (June - September) using the closed bag or capped tube incubation method. Standard litter decomposition studies using mesh bags will be conducted inside and outside exclosures and at suppressed and released sites.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: Terrestrial, Freshwater, and Marine Ecosystems, Goal 5 - Quantify and understand factors influencing patterns of temporal and spatial variability in key ecosystem components.The purpose of this investigation is to determine the extent of the apparent height and area release of willows across Yellowstones northern range since the restoration of wolves in 1995.  We will determine the willow species involved in the release, the areas where the release is occurring, the hydrologic and topographic position of released willows, and the relation of the willow release to any changes in elk winter distributions and densities.  In order to make this landscape-scale assessment, we need to map all the willows on the northern range (no valid willow map currently exists).  We will also survey the number of willow thickets formed post-wolf versus those existing pre-wolf, by back-aging released shoots and stems of willows.  All willow thickets will be mapped.  Another purpose of our study will be to document the effects of willow thicket formation post-wolf restoration on ecosystem processes, on nutrient inputs to the ecosystem, on plant community structure and microclimate, and on any potential spiraling effects of thicket formation on downstream vegetation structure and recruitment.  We suspect new willow thickets may be more likely to form immediately downstream of existing thickets, due to a combination of increased inputs of recruitment materials (seeds, shoot sections, root sections), and increased nutrients to downstream sites.  Finally, using simple models, we will project the extent of willow thicket recovery that will occur under a variety of weather patterns (normal, wet, dry), wolf densities (high, low), and elk population sizes (current, higher, lower).\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan This research will allow us to present managers with forecasts of the effects of changes in elk distribution on riparian shrub communities, and the potential cascading effects on elk-wolf dynamics. We will evaluate specific prescriptions for management of elk. We will provide managers with information on the influence on ecosystem processes as a result of height release of willows.  By so doing, this research will support decisions on management of riparian communities and identify key ecosystem variables driving changes in riparian plant and animal communities in YNP.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Establishment of long-term ungulate grazing research sites and effects of grazing and perscribed burning on plants and soils in a high elevation sagebrush steppe ecosystem in Wyoming\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages roughly 107 million ha (264 million acres) of land across the western United States and Alaska.  Much of this land (45 million ha) in the western U.S. is sagebrush steppe vegetation type.  A unique and rare opportunity exists at the Stratton study area and adjacent lands west of Saratoga, Wyoming, to develop a long-term research site and create a natural outdoor laboratory on BLM-managed lands.  This area is unique for several reasons: (1) it is representative of the high elevation sagebrush steppe, which is found throughout Colorado and Wyoming; (2) it has been largely unmanipulated and undisturbed for the past > 20 years; and (3) it has a history of 30+ years of research to provide baseline data and reveal how past activities have impacted the landscape and the sagebrush steppe ecology.  In short, this area can reveal how short-term historical disturbances (15 years) have affected the natural system because there are data available from revious research.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Historical data summary.  In early FY04 using existing USGS money, we will evaluate, conduct analyses if necessary using SAS statistical software version 8 (SAS Institue 1988), and write a synthesis of the past 20 years of research that was conducted on the Stratton study area and adjacent areas.  The summary report will be completed by August, 2004 and will be made available to BLM managers in the Rawlins Field Office, as well as regionally and nationally to others who manage similar sagebrush steppe habitats.  Long term research site establishment.   We propose to establish 8-12 exclosures in key sites for long-term grazing ecology studies.  In early FY04 we will research, scope, and identify appropriate areas for exclosure sites using a stratified random sampling study design.  In FY04, prior to exclosure establishment, we will collect pre-treatment data at each site.  Thus, the main treatment effect in the long-term study design will be grazing, and this will be tested by comparing the exclosures with adjacent reference areas (paired plots) of the same vegetation type.  Measurements inside of exclosures will be concentrated in the center of the exclosure, in an attempt to remove fenceline effects caused by disturbance during fence building and increased precipitation effects caused by drifted snow, which could be considerable at higher elevations.Grazing ecology study.   In FY04 we will put in place 5 grazing utilization cages/site and 3 small mammal grazing utilization cages/site to measure large and small mammal offtake.  Cages will be moved and clipped each winter prior to spring greenup to measure winter consumption by ungulates and small mammals.  We will clip at peak growing season to measure summer offtake and herbaceous production, move cages, and clip again in late August or early September to measure any compensatory production or offtake from ungulates and small mammals using a  m2 metal ring to clip equal amounts in grazed and ungrazed plots.  Plant material will be placed in paper bags, oven dried at 41 C for 12-24 hours, weighed, and analyzed by the difference method:% Consumption = 100 x (Bi  - Bo)/Biwhere Bi = dry weight of biomass inside grazing cage, and Bo = dry weight of biomass outside cage.  Researchers will estimate the amount of ground cover in each metal ring before clipping, and recorded percent cover of grass, forbs, rock, lichen, moss, cactus, and bare ground.Soil samples will be taken in FY04 from each exclosure site both inside and outside (6/site) of permanent grazing exclosures using soil cores at 5cm, 10 cm and 15 cm in depth to determine soil nitrogen concentrations.Prescribed fire study.  In early FY04 we will collect pre-burn vegetation and ground cover data from the planned Middlewood Hill prescribed burn site.  Vegetation and ground cover data will continue to be collected during growing seasons following the burn.Sagebrush manipulation study.  The Rawlins Field Office is interested in manipulating sagebrush stands using both prescribed fire and mechanical methods.  This study would consist of an experimental approach for comparing various types of sagebrush manipulations to control sites.  The effects of sagebrush stand manipulation on sage grouse habitat would be measured.Watershed/riparian studies.

      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: Status and Trends of Biological Resources, Goal 4 - Produce and provide analyses and reports that synthesize information on the status and trends of our Nations's flora, fauna, and ecosystems and are responsive to the needs of the scientific community, land and resource managers, policy makers, and the public.Land managers are interested in presribed burning and herbivory effects on plants and soils in the sagebrush steppe.  Domestic cattle, pronghorn antelope, mule deer, and elk are the large mammal species currently present in the proposed study area.  Managers need information on current grazing levels, affects of herbivory on plant communities, and whether grazing is affecting more long-term ecological processes, such as soil N pools, fluxes, and mineralization rates to better manage this ecosystem.  In addition, upland sagebrush steppe is habitat of concern for the management of sage grouse.  This area provides the opportunity to learn more about this critical habitat type for sage grouse conservation.  Research on post-burning effects will provide valuable information for the BLM Sage Grouse Habitat Conservation Strategy.The proposed research will provide the BLM with: (1) a synthesis of the history of research in the Stratton study area and adjacent areas.(2) an annotated bibliography of past/current research in the area.(3) baseline data from 20 years ago to now on the grazing ecology of the area, which includes pre-burn data.(4) establishment of long-term grazing research sites to create a long-term laboratory on these BLM lands.(5) grazing and ground cover survey information on the affects of ungulate grazing on plant nutrient concentrations, soil nitrogen levels, plant structure and sizes, herbaceous production in the area, and current level of grazing, which can be compared to historical data.(5) an evaluation of burning treatment effects to sagebrush ecosystems and an evaluation of grazing plus burning in sagebrush ecosystems. The goal of this research is to establish a long-term research and monitoring site in a high elevation sagebrush steppe habitat, and to evaluate the Rawlins Field Office practise of grazing an area 1 season post-burn, compared to BLM as a whole which recommends grazing only 2 seasons after a burn.  No other long-term research site exists within a high-elevation sagebrush steppe vegetation type. BLM is making a  commitment to using public lands as laboratories by setting up the Stratton area for long-term research on sagebrush steppe ecological issues.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle NRPP--Ecology of Height Release of Willow Thickets Following Wolf Reintroduction\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In much of the Greater Yellowstone region riparian willow are key species.  There is evidence that riparian willow in Yellowstones northern winter range have declined during the last 7-8 decades.  Willows present are often suppressed by browsing.  The intensity of browsing appears to vary by elevation with more extensive suppressed willow at lower elevations.  Willow height and extent affect microclimate, soil moisture, and ecosystem processes such as organic carbon and nitrogen production and mineralization rates.  Willows released from browsing can have a more direct effect on aquatic ecosystem chemical and physical properties through the input of dissolved and particulate organics, essential inorganic nutrients, and temperature.        The primary factor thought to affect browsing intensity on willow in the northern winter range is elk.  Park Service management of elk numbers in the northern range has been controversial for much of the 20th century.  Elk numbers were reduced by various means from the 1930s until 1968.  From about 1970 to 1995 elk numbers increased.  In 1995 wolves were reintroduced to the northern range.  There are several lines of evidence to suggest the presence of wolves may have reduced elk densities by 15-20% on the northern range in part by predation but primarily by elk redistribution.  A number of studies suggest the reduction in elk densities has already resulted in the release of other vegetation species as aspen.     Also see Partners Project 832508P 2.24\n",
      "\t\tMethodology There were six pre-selected riparian study sites included in the 2005-06 study: three willow release sites (confluence of Lamar River and Soda Butte Creek [LSB], Crystal Creek [CC], and West Blacktail Lower [WBL]), and three suppressed sites (East Blacktail Upper [EBU], East Blacktail Lower [EBL], and West Blacktail Upper [WBU]).  In addition, the suppressed sites were equipped with replicated elk exclosures and constructed dams to simulate potential effects of change in subsurface soil water levels and herbivory.  We collected data from within and without a subset of the exclosures.To date we have conducted the following analyses on both suppressed and released willow thickets and individual plants within and external exclosures: biomass, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) production in litterfall, soil total C and N pool size and N and C mineralization rates, subsurface hydrology, soil and stream water organic and inorganic chemistry, and soil trace gas efflux during and following snowmelt.  Also see Partners Project 832508P 2.24\n",
      "\t\tObjectives 1) re-survey the number of willow thickets formed since 1995 (post-wolf reintroduction) and compare with prior findings, 2) quantify the effects of willow thicket formation on plant community structure, microclimate, riparian nutrient input, soil carbon and nitrogen pools, and riparian contributions to the aquatic ecosystem, 3) evaluate potential downstream spiraling effects on willow re-establishment and structure, 4) using replicated artificial beaver dams and elk exclosures, quantify the effects of variation in subsurface water levels and herbivory on basic ecosystem processes, and 5) simulate the potential longer-term effects of weather shifts, herbivory by elk, and wolf herbivore predation on riparian willow thicket formation.

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The weather (climate?) of the northern range apparently has changed since 1995 relative to the previous record.  All mean monthly temperatures have warmed with the most pronounced increase in winter.  Since 1995 winters are warmer and drier than before.The percentage willow cover on the pre-selected suppressed sites averaged <25% and >65% on released sites.  The difference in area extent was an important factor in site productivity as indexed by litter fall.   Except during snowmelt, there was little evidence of  hydrologic linkage between the biologically active shallow soils and surface organic layers with the aquatic ecosystem during the study period.  The riparian well water height data indicate that the pre-selected study sites do not have similar subsurface hydrology.  The released willow sites were characterized by shallower minimal soil water depths and more moist soils throughout the growing season.  This factor could be a significant driver separating released and suppressed willow.  Soil temperatures for all sites up through September were near optimal for soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization assuming soil moisture was not limited.  Beneath willow the growing season diurnal soil temperature change was <3 o C up to leaf fall when it increased to > 7o C prior to snowpack formation.  In non-willow areas, the diurnal change in soil temperature was > 2 times that beneath willow.    Soil respiration rates declined or showed no trend with increased soil temperatures.  Such a lack of response is generally the result of limited soil moisture.  However, soil moisture did not appear limiting.  Other factors, such as soil labile carbon, may have been involved.Autumn 2005 litter fall was significantly greater beneath released willow.  Litter fall beneath willow in the exclosures did not differ from that outside.  This suggests that factors other than herbivory could be limiting growth at these formerly suppressed sites (recently confirmed by PhD thesis).  There are major differences between suppressed and released willow litter layer depths and amounts which likely help account for soil moisture and temperature differences.  We collected an extensive and intensive set of weekly inorganic and organic stream water chemistry.  Base cation data showed the sites to be dominated by deeper subsurface soil water from early August to mid-October.  Most sites showed elevated stream water nitrate concentrations following snowmelt and up to late July.  The higher nitrate concentrations appeared to be from later snowmelt removing solutes at higher elevations above the research sites.  In late October there was strong evidence of an increase in dissolved organics leaving the terrestrial ecosystem and entering the stream.  These are important solute inputs especially to the bacterial base of the aquatic foodweb.Also see Partners Project 832508P 2.24\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Elk and bison grazing ecology and management in Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The establishment of Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve and the new Baca National Wildlife Refuge in the San Luis Valley of Colorado was one of the most significant land conservation actions in the U.S. west in recent years.  The action was a result of cooperation between the NPS, FWS,BLM, USFS, and The Nature Conservancy.  The new national park will consist of 107,265 acres, the new national preserve, 41,872 acres, and the new national wildlife refuge, 92,180 acres. The area encompassed by this designation protects a number of natural wonders and features including a unique ecosystem of natural sand dunes, the entire watershed of surface and ground waters that are necessary to preserve and recharge the dunes and adjacent wetlands, a unique stunted forest, and other valuable riparian vegetation communities that support a host of associated wildlife and bird species.  The Nature Conservancy acquired the Baca Ranch for national wildlife refuge designation and also acquired and manages the Medano-Zapata Ranch to protect its rich natural resources.  TNC manages about 1,500 bison on the Medano-Zapata(MZ)Ranch, which is located within the core of the protected lands.  The bison population is not supplementally fed any hay or grain. The herds growth is controlled by the round-up and sale of bison calves and yearlings each year. TNC seeks to eventually maintain a larger, semi-wild population of perhaps 1,800-3,000 bison on the MZ Ranch and adjacent NPS and NWR lands. The boundaries of the bison use area are currently fenced to keep the bison in.  The bison management goals of the TNC include taking down large portions of this fence to encourage a more natural annual movement of the bison, encouraging (through opening/closure of water holes, and driving) a natural tendency of the bison to migrate to the north end of the ranch each summer and to the south end each winter, in order to rest the vegetation for part of each year. A recent ecoregional planning effort identified this area as the best site in the southern Rockies to support a semi-wild, self-sustaining population of bison (Chris Pague, pers. commun., 1 March 2002, TNC). The planning group recommended 300,000 acres of grazing land as necessary to support such a bison population.  TNC has estimated that the MZ Ranch alone should not hold more than 1,800 animal units.  Thus, the  challenge is to both increase the current size of the bison herd, yet not exceed the limits of the range.  The impact of herbivory from such a large bison herd on local plant communities is currently not known.Bison currently graze many sectors of the ranch, such as some wet meadows, year-round. Year-round grazing of the same areas is not a recommended range management technique, nor does it typically occur in natural bison grazing systems.  Moreover, elk forage seasonally in some of the same areas as the bison.  Both elk and bison use cottonwood and willow patches for loafing, bedding, and feeding habitat.  Concentrations of large ungulates in these woody patches for extended periods has resulted in barking of trees and shrub stemsand high browse levels.  A general trend toward dune deposition is burying many willow and younger cottonwood individuals, thus reducing their growth potential and making them even more vulnerable to heavy browsing.  The potential exists for rapid death and loss, likely within the next 5 years, of many of the younger patches of these unique and rare woody riparian vegetation communities that are interspersed throughout the dune complex.  The older cottonwood stands will persist longer, but they too will disappear with no recruitment of new stems.  The cottonwood stands are the only forested component of the dunes complex, and the stands provide nesting habitat for many birds that otherwise would not use the dunes complex.Managers also seeks to know how bison grazing on the MZ Ranch influences soil nutrient processes and pools.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Elk Distribution and Habitat Use.  We will capture and radio collar 65 adult elk using a net gun and OAS approved contractor and corral and clover trapping in conjunction with CDOW. We will radio-locate these animals twice per month during the migration period to determine extent and range of movements in a fixed-wing aircraft. We will estimate elk population size by flying aerial surveys 3x/winter and record sighting variables for a correction. We will plot elk groups to determine distribution. A GIS-based elk habitat model will be developed using the elk locations. Using this model we can project the areas that elk will potentially use across the entire study area.Elk Population Size and Dynamics.  We will estimate elk population size by flying aerial surveys 3x/winter and recording sighting variables. We will provide a basis for improved abundance estimates for this population. Currently, annual aerial surveys are conducted by CDOW that classify a sample of the population to sex and age. No methods are used, or data collected, to correct these raw counts for sighting bias, nor does this method provide a basis for computing precision (confidence internals).  Sightability bias correction models have been developed (Samuel et al. 1987); Unsworth et al 1994; Lubow et al. 2002) and tested for other elk herds (National Bison Range, Starkey Research Area). Existing models require collection of additional covariates such as group size, snow cover, and tree cover. We will gather the required variables and apply these to raw counts to improve population estimates. We will use models developed across large areas of Idaho and also models tested in Colorado (Freddy et al. 200; Lubow et al. 2002) that have been found generally applicable to large areas. Forty data points will be gathered for sightability variables and these points will be tested against the Idaho model. If the Great Sand Dunes data is parsimonious with the Idaho model, we will process with a combined model of Idaho and Great Sand Dunes data points. If the Great Sand Dunes data is not consistent with the Idaho data, we will develop a specific sightability model for the Great Sand Dunes complex of lands.    We will combine our unbiased estimates of population size with existing calf production and yearling recruitment rates samples by CDOW to provide a basis for a simple population model to this elk herd. About 15 years of helicopter data is available for the entire elk herd. We will fit a series of alternative hypothesized models to the available data using maximum likelihood estimation and select the most appropriate, parsimonious model from the set using Akaikes Information Criterion (Burnham and Anderson 2002). We will calculate the rate of population increase (lambda) and attempt to identify evidence for density dependence, particularly in calf recruitment. Correlation of appropriate weather covariates with annual recruitment can be explored. If possible, we will estimated food-limited carrying capacity from the population growth trajectory following procedures described in Lubow et al. (2002) and White and Lubow (2002). Bison Habitat Use and Distribution.  Fourteen bison (10 female, 4 male) will be radio-collated during routine corral trap operations. We will place GPS/radio collars on 4 bison for frequent monitoring and better habitat use information.  We will fly 2 surveys/year for overall population distribution. We will track bison on foot and locate all collars each week.Vegetation and Management Studies.  We will erect 24 new ungulate proof exclosures; 8 cottonwood, 8 in willow, 8 in wet meadow (especially spiderflower sites). We will also locate any other suitable already existing exclosures (e.g., any ungrazed fenced areas). See Communication section for continuation of methods.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources, #2 - Provide tools and techniques, such as predictive models, decision support, and expert systems, for science-based management of wildlife and plant populations and their habitats.Our objectives are to:(1)  Determine the current population status of elk, and current year-round distribution and movements of elk.(2)  Evaluate the effects of bison and elk herbivory on plant communities, especially on shrub and tree recruitment, not only from browsing, but also from rubbing and thrashing.(3)  Determine the suitable habitat and population potential (ecological and nutritional carrying capacity) for elk on Nature Conservancy lands, in the Park Unit, the Preserve Unit, the U.S. National Forest Units, and the new national refuge lands. (4)  Develop an elk/bison grazing model that includes grazing as a significant natural ecological process, and also protects sensitive native plant communities.  Cattle grazing will be included in the model. (5)  Provide information for developing a predictive model to be used in a planning process for management agencies.  Lay out management scenarios to predict effects on ungulate populations, changes in distributions, habitat selection, and migrations.(6)  Monitor the effects of treatments and new experiments on the distribution and movements of elk.  Experiments and treatments that have been discussed include special hunts to move elk from certain areas, removal of water, removing fences, and adding fences (e.g. to keep elk from crossing main Highway 17 and adjacent seed potato farms).  When developing predictive scenarios, the study team should identify goals that are common amongst the management agencies or organizations.  Emphasize GIS products for each scenario that are easy to understand and clear to managers.  Develop alternative scenarios.  Cattle grazing needs to be incorporated into the potential scenarios, since continuing with some form of cattle grazing is an option for TNC.  The managers suggested that standard values for forage intake, energy needs, typical grazing areas, etc. be used in the model and that extensive efforts not be made to generate new basic values for cattle.(7)  Evaluate the effect of bison grazing on soil nitrogen processes.(8)  Evaluate the interaction of climate and ungulate herbivory on cottonwood and willow through establishment and analysis of recruitment dates (using dendrochronology) and correlations to water tables and precipitation patterns.(9)  Determine the genetic variability in the current Medano-Zapata bison herd.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan We will submit an Investigator's Annual Report (IAR) to the park service each year.  The IAR for 2005 will be completed in December, 2005 and submitted to NPS.  We will also complete a final report at the end of the study, and submit research findings to peer-reviewed journals for publication.We will make a minimum of 1 presentation/year to the agencies' Senior Managers' Meeting (organized by TNC) to report on the status of the project and any relevant findings, and conduct a final presentation/close-out at the end of the study.Methodology Continued...We will sample these exclosures and paired grazing sizes for plant production responses; plant species responses (using modified Whittaker plots); offtake (grazing utilization cages and shrub measurements); and willow/cottonwood density, recruitment, and death. Interactions of Herbivory, Climate and Irrigation.  We will age both cottonwood and willow(willows aged at basal root crowns) to determine the year they were established.  We will establish water wells at each paired exclosure/grazed site. We will attempt to correlate fluctuations in water tables and precipitation to periods of woody establishment. Is herbivory correlated to declining water tables or to partial sand burial? Damaged or stressed plants are often more susceptible to browsing and are often more palatable to ungulates during periods of stress. Thus drought could exacerbate the effect of herbivory of an increasing ungulate population. We will compare partially buried to unburied willows. Elk and Bison Grazing Model and Estimates of Carrying Capacity.  We will estimate carrying capacity using two complementary methods: First, we will use the method of forage biomass-based estimate of carrying capacity for elk that has been used in the Swiss National Parks model (Hozgang 1997) and for elk and bison in the Greater Teton Ecosystem (GTE) (Hobbs et al., 2003). This method uses available forage, estimated offtake levels and forage requirements to estimate ungulate numbers that can be supported across large landscapes. Using GIS technology, this method will be coded into a model which will allow simulation of the needed management scenarios outlines in the next section. Inputs for this model will be products derived from the Vegetation Studies (above), existing Park and area vegetation maps, and estimates of ungulate forage requirements derived from previous research in similar systems. Second, we will estimate carrying capacity using the mathematical approach outline by Hobbs et al(1982) and also used in the GTE (Hobbs et al., 2003). This spreadsheet/mathematical model relies on forage quantity/quality and ungulate nutritional needs to derive an estimate. Inputs for this model will come from sampling of forage quality (nitrogen concentrations) in key elk habitats, as well as prior research in similar systems. Bison Herd Genetic Make-up.  We will take hair samples from bison during the annual round-up. These will be used for DNA sampling to determine the current genetic diversity in the herd.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Effects of Roads and Land Management Practices on Wildlife Behavior\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Wildlife populations across the United States are benefiting from improved wildlife management techniques.  However, these benefits are also creating new challenges including over population, disease, increased winter kill and forage degradation.  These issues have become the challenges of current natural resource managers and landowners.  Specifically, elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Gunnison River Valley of Colorado are growing in population and causing increasing resource damage on public and private lands.  On public lands elk threaten sage grouse habitat and compete with domestic livestock for available forage; on private lands they damage orchards and diminish fodder for livestock.  Management of elk herds in the area is a shared responsibility of NPS (Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park and Curecanti National Recreation Area), BLM, USFS (Gunnison National Forest), and the Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW). All of these agencies will participate in this research and adaptive management project.The key issue in this area as well as several other similar areas,  is the interaction between intensity of human use and wildlife habitat selection and use. One example of these interactions is the perceived early season elk movement to private lands precipitated by the increasing popularity of  Off Highway Vehicles, OHVs. Data on human use is extremely limited.  We propose to monitor intensity of motorized vehicle and trail use as metrics of human use, monitor elk movements and habitat use where additional and analyze interactions.  If management agencies decide to alter accessibility, we will monitor (again where necessary) wildlife responses.  This provides a unique opportunity for adaptive management experimentation based on coordinated research and monitoring.  The products from this project will provide natural resource managers across the nation with tools and information to better meet these resource challenges.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Observations will begin with baseline monitoring under current accessibility conditions.  Monitored variables will include vehicular traffic; trail use (in select strategic places); and animal movements.  The human activity observations will drive a model that estimates frequency or probability of human presence.Observations will continue when accessibility conditions are altered by closing gates, for example) or of signs.  The on-the-ground changes help in calibrating models of human presence and animal response. If the models work well, they will help managers to design optimal schemes for herd management through manipulation of human access.Pneumatic vehicle counters, which can discriminate vehicle type and speed, will document road, jeep-trail, and ATV-trail traffic.  Arrays of non-imaging passive infrared counters deployed on foot trails will record pedestrian and equestrian traffic.  Elk movement will be monitored using global positioning system (GPS) and very high frequency (VHF).\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: Terrestrial, Freshwater, and Marine Ecosystems, Goal 5 - Quantify and understand factors influencing patterns of temporal and spatial variability in key ecosystem components.The objective of this project is to monitor elk habitat use using GPS technology and the second is to monitor motorized vehicle use including OHVs .  This monitoring will provide a foundation for the development of adaptive management models to develop scenarios of elk habitat use with varying levels of intensity of use by humans.   This will also provide the research basis for using traffic management as an indirect tool for wildlife management.  Close collaboration with local management agencies provides options for manipulating accessibility of public lands and observing wildlife responses.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan These will be developed in the third and subsequent years of the project.  The Web will be used as the primary medium of data release, following use of data for research.  Technical publications will be prepared that describe methods for data gathering, data analysis, and modeling.  If management-agency collaborators deem it appropriate, the handbook for using access manipulation as a wildlife management tool will be published as a USGS or other-agency handbook.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Effects of elk herbivory on alpine plant communities on the elk summer range of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado: An analysis of existing data\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Problems caused by the overabundance or over-concentration of large mammals have concerned wildlife managers and scientists for decades (Caughley 1981).  This problem exists within and surrounding Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP), Colorado. The RMNP staff is concerned about the effects of high numbers of elk on alpine and subalpine willow and tundra communities located in the parks high central mountains (Stevens 1980; Therese Johnson, RMNP, personal communication).  At least 3 different elk populations that winter along the outside of the parks western and eastern boundaries commingle on alpine summer range in the park.  All 3 populations have been increasing in recent decades (Lubow et al. 2003; S. Steinert, Colorado Division of Wildlife, unpublished data).  Approximately 150-200 elk also winter at these high elevations, and may be browsing willow communities to a great extent during winter.  Park management is concerned elk use of alpine willows is excessive during summer.  Alpine willow communities are crucial to the park's population of white-tailed ptarmigan (Braun and Rogers 1971; Braun et al. 1976).  State of Colorado biologists have reported declines in white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus altipetens) in core areas along Trail Ridge, and have attributed the decline to willow habitat declines due to high densities of elk (Braun et al. 1991).  Former park biologist, David Stevens, reported significant declines in willows at 4 long term sites monitored in the 1970s and 1980s (Stevens 1993).  White-tailed ptarmigan populations have declined about 55% during the period 1975-1999 in a study area on Trail Ridge in RMNP (Wang et al. 2002).  This period of decline roughly corresponds to a period of substantial increase in the Estes Valley elk population (Lubow et al. 2003), which summers in the alpine/subalpine areas of the interior of RMNP.  Thus, the elk increases may be related to the ptarmigan decline (Braun et al. 1991).  White-tailed ptarmigan are obligate habitat specialists that require willows.  White-tailed ptarmigan may use two height strata of willows: (1) short, often dwarf, willows (7-24 cm in height) are preferred during the summer months (Frederick and Gutierrez 1992) and during the winter months, when these areas are blown largely snow free (Braun et al. 1976; F. Singer, personal observation in Alaska); (2) taller shrub willows (>90 cm), more typically found at or below the treeline that are avoided when there is no snow (Frederick and Gutierrez 1992), but whose crowns become more accessible when the birds walk on deeper snow (Braun et al. 1976; F. Singer, pers. obs.).\n",
      "\t\tMethodology I will analyze the existing alpine and subalpine transect data collected over 25 years (1968-1992) by former park biologist, David Stevens.  These data were collected in an attempt to determine trends in park plant communities that were heavily impacted by ungulate grazing.  If available, I will also analyze any data collected by Dave Stevens since 1992.  Prior analysis of similar data from low elevation winter range transects has identified trends in species diversity and shrub cover decline (Zeigenfuss et al. 1999).  However, as pointed out in the earlier analysis (Zeigenfuss et al. 1999), these plots were limited in number and not randomly selected, so inference may be limited.  Statistical analysis methods will follow those in Zeigenfuss et al. (1999).\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Vegetation data were collected on 11 transects in alpine and subalpine willow and tundra plant communities at approximately 5 year intervals over a 25-year period from 1968-1992, however those data were never subjected to any rigorous statistical analysis to detect trends over that time period.  Analysis of this data could be useful to park managers prior to initiating further research or monitoring in these communities.  Data that were collected include elk and deer habitat use, plant cover and composition, and willow height and growth form.The study objectives will address the following questions:1)What was the trend in plant cover, heights, species composition, and ungulate days use over the 25 year period from 1968-1992?2)What was the measured consumption rates of willows during this time period?3)Were there correlations between consumption rates and ungulate days use with plant abundance, species composition, and shrub canopy cover, heights or density, in RMNP alpine and subalpine plant communities through 1992?  4)Was there a decline in subalpine willow heights that may have indicated decreasing subalpine willow habitat for white-tailed ptarmigan over the 25-year study period?\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan We will complete a final report to Park management by July 15, 2005. Copies of all electronic data files will be given to the park.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The majority of the elk (Cervus elaphus) population of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado summer in the Parks high elevation alpine and subalpine meadows and willow krummholz.  The Parks population of white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus altipetens) depends on both dwarf and krummholz willows for food and cover.  Concern about the effects of elk herbivory on these communities prompted the monitoring of 12 vegetation transects in these regions from 1971-1996.  Over this 25-year period, data was collected on plant species cover and frequency and shrub heights.  This data has not been statistically analyzed for trends in the measured variables over time to determine changes in species abundance.  Krummholz willow species (Salix planifolia, S. brachycarpa) declined 17-20% in cover and ~25 cm in height over the study period.  Graminoids (particularly Deschampsia caespitosa, Carex, and Poa) increased slightly from 1971-1996.  No significant increases of non-native plant species were observed.  An increase in presence of bare ground over the 25-year period warrants continued measurement of these transects.  Lack of good data on elk density, distribution, or use levels precludes correlating changes in plant species cover, frequency, or heights with elk population trends.  I recommend development of a more rigorously designed monitoring program that includes these transects as well as others chosen on a random or stratified design and consistent measurement protocol and sampling intervals.  Some method of quantifying elk use, either through measurement of plant utilization, pellet counts, or census-type surveys, would allow correlation of changes in plant species over time with changes in elk distribution and density on the Parks alpine and subalpine regions.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments A final report detailing the analysis and conclusions was submitted to Judy Visty, Research Coordinator, Rocky Mountain National Park, January 2006.  Report was submitted as a USGS Open File Report available at the USGS Fort Collins Science Center website in June 2006.  All electronic data and electronic versions of the report were submitted to Therese Johnson, Biologist, Rocky Mountain National Park in April 2006.  A poster on this research was presented at the Rocky Mountain National Park Biennial Scientific Research Conference in April 2006.\n"

      "\t\tTaskTitle Implementation of a Monitoring Plan for Vegetation Responses to New Elk Management in Rocky Mountain National Park\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The National Park Service (NPS), Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) and agencies responsible for management of land and wildlife resources adjacent to the park are in the process of developing and evaluating alternatives for managing elk and vegetation in and around Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. The goal of this planning effort is reduction of adverse effects of elk herbivory on vegetation, and decreasing conflicts between people and elk. The management actions implemented in response to this plan will attempt to restore the natural range of variability in both the elk population and affected plant communities.  An environmental impact statement (EIS) is in preparation to evaluate the effects of a range of management alternatives on the natural and human environment.  A record of decision is expected on this EIS in spring of 2007.  After that time, management actions prescribed by the plan will be implemented, and there will be a need to assess the effectiveness of such actions in accomplishing plan goals.  The park will need established monitoring locations as well as tested and cost-effective methods to monitor the response of the elk population and key vegetation communities to these management actions.  Baseline data from these monitoring sites by which to measure change over time will also be necessary.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology In 2001, USGS scientists designed an inventory and monitoring plan for RMNP(Stohlgren 2001) that included subplans which addressed monitoring of elk and their impacts on vegetation and monitoring of aspen. We will use these plans as the foundation to develop a revised monitoring plan for elk and vegetation. The monitoring plan will be developed in collaboration with park resources management staff to assure that it includes elements necessary to measure the impacts of the new elk management plan.  Methods and elements for monitoring will be selected with attention to their utility as inputs to the ecosystem model developed to assess the role of elk in the RMNP ecosystem. We will select vegetation monitoring sites and gather limited baseline data. The results of these activities will be incorporated into the monitoring plan, including identification of all vegetation monitoring sites, detailed protocols describing methods of vegetation monitoring, recommendations of sampling frequency and sample size for all monitoring elements, suggestions for statistical analyses/modeling of data collected as part of the monitoring program, and how to use the results of these analyses to measure success of management actions. Elk distribution data will used to create better distribution and density maps for elk on the Estes Valley winter range. Information from this analysis will be used to stratify the winter range for the purposes of selecting an appropriate array of vegetation monitoring sites.  We will use the new vegetation classification map for RMNP to determine which vegetation classes should be used combined to cover the 4 types of interest to this plan--aspen, willow, wet meadow, and upland grassland/meadow. Stratification of sites will be targeted at representing the range of elk distribution and density as well as focusing on areas that are most likely to be affected by proposed management. In this way, pre-treatment data could be collected by park staff immediately prior to implementation of any management actions. Number of samples will follow recommendations found in the earlier plan. A list of potential sites will be produced by the National Park Service Rocky Mountain Inventory and Monitoring Network so that there can be overlap, where possible, between the NPS monitoring network and Rocky Mountain National Parks vegetation monitoring. A field crew will begin locating proposed study sites in late summer 2006. When suitable sites are located, permanent survey stake markers will be placed at the site and will serve as photo-points, or other marking system as described by NPS protocols will be followed. The site locations will be recorded using a GPS. Grazing cages will be placed at the sites to measure winter herbaceous consumption rates.  Initial measurements of vegetation structure and site characteristics will be recorded. We will provide training on measurement of initial ungulate winter consumption rates to park staff in spring 2007, though actual measurement of all plots would be conducted by RMNP. We will also assess the continued utility of existing exclosures. A map of suitable willow habitat on the winter range will be produced by the NPS RM I&M Network staff. During summer 2006, the field crew will establish sample points and assess current condition of willow in areas that are currently classified as being suitable willow habitat but have a predominantly grass/forb cover. These points will become part of the monitoring of willow cover in the final plan. Any aspen stand locations that coincide with those that are currently being measured as part of ongoing NRPP study of the effects of elk herbivory on ecology of aspen will be integrated and data collection as part of the NRPP study will be conducted during fall 2006.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives In fall of 2003, the elk and vegetation management planning process was initiated and scoping of issues, formulation of preliminary alternatives, and workshops to inform and involve the public were conducted through winter 2005.  Currently, the park staff is working with the cooperating agencies to finalize the range of alternatives. Publication of the draft management plan and EIS is scheduled for spring 2006, with publication of the final plan and EIS in later winter/spring 2007, and a record of decision to follow in early summer 2007.  The research and planning process related to this topic has been ongoing for a decade and a half.  During that time, the human population, both immediately adjacent to, and within a 50 mile radius of the park has continued to grow at a rapid pace.  The public will expect swift action following the publication of the record of decision.  Rocky Mountain National Park will need to hit the ground running in 2007, being fully prepared to not only implement management actions, but to monitor the effectiveness, impacts, and implications of those actions.  RMNP staff has already identified several key parameters that will be monitored.  These include elk population size and distribution; structure and utilization levels in willow, aspen, and upland shrub (bitterbrush, sagebrush, Pondersosa pine ecotone) areas.  The objective of this study is to design and implement a monitoring plan for the park that will help them assess the effectiveness of their management actions and adapt the management actions when and where necessary to continue achieving the management plans intended goals.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan The result of this research will be a monitoring plan which includes detailed protocols for all sampling methods and recommendations on interpretation of the data collected through this monitoring program.  Electronic maps of monitoring site locations, and elk density, distribution, and location data will be provided to the park.  Site characterization and baseline data acquired during 2006 will be entered into a database and provided to park staff for use in adding future monitoring data. Training sessions will be conducted for permanent (and any 2007 seasonal) park staff involved with the implementation of elk/vegetation monitoring protocols.The monitoring plan will be used by resource management staff to monitor and assess the effects of elk management actions on elk herbivory in key vegetation communities in RMNP.  The data gathered through this monitoring program will give park management personnel the information necessary to make adaptive management decisions.  Protocols will provide park staff with standardized instructions and data sheets for consistent collection of data from one sampling period to the next.  Maps of monitoring site locations, including UTM coordinates, will allow quick and accurate location of these sites for field personnel using a GPS.  Field training sessions will be conducted in spring 2007 to provide park staff with the opportunity to have hands-on sessions to learn the field techniques since they would ultimately be responsible for future training of park staff to continue monitoring these sites.\n",

      "\t\tAccomplishments FY07- Storage. Researched and purchased an iSCSI storage solution, which gives FORT close to 20 terabytes of centralized data storage. This solution allows rapid access to files and fulfills requirements for centralized management of storage.FY07- Researched selected and purchased a robust, secure and FIPS compliant wireless solutionFY07- Centralized System Administration. FORTs Computer Operations Team (COT) implemented a centralized disk-defragmentation software that can greatly increase system performance, disk access times, and hard-disk life. Initial analysis shows performance increases on many systems of at least 30% and up to 70%. Users no longer have to schedule or run their own defragmentation as it occurs in real-time as files are written to hard disk.FY07- Software Deployment. COT staff developed more installation packages for centralized software deployment, greatly decreasing the time spent on software installations. ArcGIS manual installations used to take close to 2 hours and can now be installed remotely and scheduled in under 15 minutes without having to visit the user location. Additional packages for Microsoft Office, Adobe products, and various third-party applications have also been created.FY07- Network Bandwidth.  The team coordinated an increase to FORT's Internet bandwidth to 4X the previous capabilities, resulting in much higher download speeds and quicker email access, which positions FORT to take on more enterprise-level projects and solutions.FY07- Backup and Restore. COT staff upgraded the backup library from a 24-tape LTO2 solution to a 120-tape LTO4 solution, which greatly increases the backup storage capabilities and backup speed of FORT data. The system is also capable of being used for remote disaster recovery planning with other USGS sites.FY07- DOI Active Directory Migration. The COT lead and network specialist successfully migrated FORT to DOI Active Directory infrastructure with no major issues or downtime. The team lead served as Coordinator for the migration of the entire Central Region, contributing to the successful migration of 100% of USGS Central Region centers/sites by the FY07 deadline.FY08- Implemented a secure backup solution and offsite storage using Commvault Backup software giving Fort rapid access to data in the event of data loss or disaster.FY09- Designed and started the implementation of a robust VmWare ESX 3.x virtualization solution for FORT servers.FY09- Upgraded Fort storage with an additional iSCSI SAN solution giving Fort centralized, secure and rapid access to terebytes of data and allowing robust hosting of FORT's new virtual server solution.FY10- Completed implementation of Fort's Virtualization solution using VmWare Vsphere 4.x. Saved over $100,000 in hardware refresh costs by completing the virtualization of 75% of Fort servers.FY10- Completed initial implementation Riverbed WAN optimization device at Fort allowing drastic increase in WAN throughput and efficiency without having to increase WAN link speeds. Working with USGS to implement same solution across entire USGS.FY10- Implemented robust software/hardware auditing and inventory, FDCC Compliance, Vulnerability Analysis, heterogenous patching of OS and 3rd party software, and centralized auditing of USGS Fort systems using Bigfix Software solutionFY10- Completed the infrastructure design to allow Fort's Grid experts to implement Grid computing across the Fort using Condor.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem This project is also under 817208L Task 4.1.Sagebrush-steppe habitats have experienced dramatic changes since European settlement.  Today, this ecosystem is considered imperiled, having decreased by about 50 percent in Western North America, and currently is undergoing intense fragmentation and degradation.  As a result, sagebrush-steppe dependent species have experienced drastic range contractions and population declines; one notable example being the Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus spp).  Sage-Grouse populations have declined by 1590% since the early 1970s, leaving populations threatened with extirpation in many of the habitats where they currently persist.  Recently (7 January 2005), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) considered Greater Sage-Grouse (C. urophasianus) populations for protection under the Federal Endangered Species Act.  The not warranted decision means that the USFWS will be closely monitoring the status of sage-grouse populations and sagebrush habitats, leaving state and federal land management agencies to develop and implement appropriate management and conservation strategies for sagebrush habitats and obligate species.  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) owns and manages approximately 50% of remaining sagebrush habitats, and, has appropriately, identified management at large landscape scales as a priority.  However, despite current research identifying resources requirements for many sagebrush obligate species at local scales, a lack of methodologies to accurately assess and monitor habitats at large scales has prevented landscape scale management from occurring.  Current landscape scale sagebrush maps have been shown to be inaccurate, at best.  In order to manage sagebrush habitats across the landscape, accurate assessments of sagebrush, identifying species, subspecies, and vegetation attributes such as canopy cover and height are required.  This will allow for appropriate management actions to be developed to protect sagebrush obligate wildlife species.  In addition, current products quantifying anthropogenic features within sagebrush habitats grossly underestimate these developments, limiting the ability of the BLM to develop appropriate land management decisions.  To monitor species responses to changes on the landscape and develop sound management plans, the BLM first needs accurate assessments of sagebrush habitats, roads and energy developments.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Using multi-spectral spatial data sets of varying resolution (i.e. Quickbird [0.6 m], ASTER [15 m], Landsat [30 m resolution], IRS [56 m]), we will use high resolution (Quickbird) data sources to develop methodologies to identify and map species, cover and height classes of sagebrush and other vegetation.  Vegetation samples will take place in the first summer (FY 06) of this project so spatial models can be developed that winter.  The high resolution quickbird imagery will also be used to classify and map all anthropogenic features within the study area.  We will scale our models up to moderate resolution data sets (i.e. Landsat, Aster) and apply these models across larger spatial extents, (i.e. the state of Wyoming) using IRS (56 m ).  An independent sample of vegetation measurements will be collected the following summer (FY 07) for validation of models at all scales.COST CENTER BUDGET BREAKDOWNFORT-BIOLOGY $130,000EROS-GEOGRAPHY $70,000DENVER-GEOLOGY $25,000\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program Element and Goal: TERRESTRIAL, FRESHWATER AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS, #2 - Model factors controlling ecosystem patterns at various scales and develop decision support systems which integrate this information with management options.The goal of this project is to develop statistically rigorous mapping products to assess habitat within the sagebrush ecosystem. These products will be the backbone of future management and planning efforts on BLM lands, and directly assist with species and ecosystem assessments, like the BLM funded Wyoming Basins Ecoregional Assessment (WBEA). While methodologies (i.e., airphoto interpretation) are available for accurately identifying anthropogenic features within sagebrush habitats, currently there are no techniques for assessing and mapping sagebrush habitats throughout western North America. More specifically, therefore, our objectives are to (1) accurately assess and map the distribution of roads, trails, and oil and gas infrastructure; (2) develop, assess, and compare the remote sensing methodologies at identifying and mapping the cover, height and distribution of various sagebrush species at three specific study sites; and (3) determine the feasibility of applying these techniques to additional BLM Field offices, at larger landscapes such as the whole state of Wyoming.Anticipated prodcuts resulting from this work include the following.(1) Estimates of historical sagebrush change for Wyoming byback-casting our sagebrush models on historical imagery to identify trends in sagebrush habitat changes for the state of Wyoming; this will allow us to analyze landscape-level habitat changes in Wyoming, tying them torelevant land-use decisions.(2) Summary of changes in oil and gas developments and associated habitat fragmentation from 1989 (possibly since 1972) to present, through applying our QuickBird scale roads model at the Landsat scale to spatially map roads across the larger Wyoming Landscape; QuickBird scenes will be used to validate the Landsat road predictions.(3) A rigorous time-series change analyses, modeling wildlife population trends against density changes in oil and gas activities and road developments; this would be based on the use of developed anthropogenic data layers and existing wildlife data sets (i.e., sage-grouse lek data and BBS data).(4) Maps that model where future developments would likely have the greatest impact on wildlife populations of interest, and also where they would have the least impacts based on analyses of the effects of increases in energy developments since 1989 (possibly since 1972) on the distribution and abundance of wildlife species, such as sage-grouse, pronghorn, and brewer's sparrows.(5) A final report summarizing findings and analysis of potential effects of different management scenarios for oil and gas developments within sagebrush habitats; this report will include recommendations on how to monitor the effects of development scenarios on key wildlife species.(6) Workshops will be held to disseminate the findings of this research with local and regional managers, discussing the implications of anthropogenic activities on wildlife, management and monitoring initiatives.(7) Peer-reviewed publications summarizing ourmethodologies for modeling habitats, monitoring anthropogenic changes, and final assessments of changes linked to wildlife population trends.(8) Wyoming-scale analysis extrapolated to ecosystem-wideanalysis by interfacing with other relevant sagebrush projects to apply our models across the west.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan This was initally a CRISP funded intitiative, partnering with the Wyoming State BLM Office.

The BLM is currently working with scientific experts to develop a Framework for Describing Sagebrush Habitats.  Several USGS scientists sit on this framework team.  The methodologies we derive from the research outlined in this proposal will feed directly into the BLMs Habitat Framework, and the WYBEA process, assisting with federal, state, and private landowners with managing sagebrush habitats.

      "\t\tTaskTitle CRISP - Quantifying the Physical Impacts of Reenacted Mormon Handcart Journeys Across the Historic Oregon-California Trail: An Aerial Photography Approach to Assess Impacts and Develop Use Thresholds in Wyoming\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In 1843, a train of wagons and people began their journey to the new frontier, traveling from Missouri across parts of Wyoming, and along the only corridor that provided access to Oregon, Idaho, Washington, California, and Nevada.  It is estimated that over the next 25 years, as many as half a million people made this historic journey along the Oregon-California Trail, with approximately 1 in every 10 dying along the way.  Use of this trail diminished in the 1870s, when the Union Pacific completed the first railway link to the west coast.  The trail was still used as a corridor to the west into the early 1900s, although to a lesser extent.  Recently (beginning in 1998), Mormon handcart emigrant companies began reenacting their ancestors historic westward trips, resulting in short duration but intense use of certain sections of the trail.  This trail is very much considered a historic relic, and concern exists over the extensive damage that may be caused to the trail through the intense use of wagons, handcarts, and motorized vehicles during these reenactments.  Other off highway vehicle use could have additional negative impacts to the integrity of the trail.  Unfortunately, the historic state of the trail is not known, and the impacts of current intensive trail use have not been assessed.  Without supporting data, BLM managers have been forced to take a shotgun-approach to defining limits to the number of people that can use the Oregon-California Trail, hoping that their target limits the impacts to the trail.  There is a need to understand the impacts of these reenactments to the trail, and develop defensible threshold levels of use that will allow the Historic Trail to remain relatively intact.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will use existing aerial photographs to quantify the historic Oregon-California Trail, associated social trails, and other established trails prior to reenactment treks (before 1998).  We will use existing (2003 or later) or yet-to-be acquired aerial photographs to quantify post-disturbance trail characteristics.  Quantification of impacts will include documenting the amount of exposed soil, width of trails, and length of all types of trails.  We will develop a model(s) that predicts impacts based on the intensity, duration, and type of use.  This model(s) will allow us to development thresholds of use that will allow BLM managers to establish use levels.  The thresholds of use will be based on a correlation of numbers and types of users with quantified levels of disturbance to the historic Oregon-California Trail.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program Element and Goal: Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources, #5 - Enhance USGS Wildlife Research to Meet Emerging and Future Issues. Build additional capabilities, expertise, and capacity in the WTER Program to meet the emerging needs of USGS partners as wildlife issues take on new importance in today's society.The goal of this project is to quantify the impacts on the historic Oregon-California Trail due to increased use by Mormon handcart companies reenacting historic treks.  We will quantify changes caused by trekkers, by comparing current aerial photographs of the trail and surrounding habitat with historic aerial photos acquired prior to the reenactments.  Specifically, our objectives will be to 1)quantify what the trail looked like prior to reenactments; 2)quantify what the trail currently looks like (post reenactments); 3)quantify the net impacts of the reenactments; 4)work with BLM field staff to compare the number, duration, and types of users along various segments of the trail in order to assess the impacts of each type of use, or combined use; and 5) develop management guidelines that will describe potential future impacts to the historic Oregon-California Trail based on the number and types of users along that trail (i.e., derive thresholds of use above which alteration of the trail from its native or historic state will occur at various measured intensities).\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan This is a CRISP funded intitiate, partnering with the Wyoming State BLM Office. This assessment will provide the BLM with baseline information quantifying the physical characteristics of the historic Oregon-California Trail at pre- and post-reenactment of the historic treks.  The threshold of use measures will provide BLM managers with an objective and quantifiable means of establishing the numbers and types of users that can access the historic Oregon-California Trail with corresponding levels of impact.  We will submit progress reports and a final report including a GIS database quantifying historic and current conditions.  Map products will be provided in both hard copy and digital form, so that the layers can be used immediately for management purposes.  We will publish our results in a peer-reviewed scientific journal(s).  We will link BLM reference on-the-ground photos with a GIS database allowing BLM staff to display on-the-ground photographs at their correct geographic location with respect to orthorectified aerial photographs, digital raster graphic (topographic map) files, interpreted vector GIS data of the Oregon-California Trail, and other relevant data types.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Stratton sagebrush ecological research site: An experimental approach to assess various grazing treatments on vegetation and wildlife communities across managed burns and habitat controls\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Grazing and burning are two tools that Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has to manage shrubsteppe ecosystems.  However, limited information exists on the timing and levels of grazing that are appropriate in these fragile systems, which allow for suitable recovery and establishment of vegetation communities, particularly after natural or prescribed burns.  In 2004 the USGS, Fort Collins Science Center, and the BLM, Rawlins Field Office began a cooperative effort to re-establish the Stratton Sagebrush Hydrology Study Area (Stratton) as a research location, with the goal of making it a site for long-term research on sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecology.  Stratton is the only high elevation sagebrush research site of its kind, with a rich 30+ year history of research and baseline data.  We have recently implemented an sound experimental design with continued data collection to address questions related to cattle grazing, controlled burns, and wildlife responses.  Our goal is to carry out monitoring and evaluation of management activities using an adaptive management approach, to properly address these pressing management questions.  Long-term monitoring of both vegetation and wildlife responses to the experimental prescribed burns and grazing treatments is necessary to appropriately evaluate both burns and cattle as management tools for the BLM.  Funds are needed to continue work at Stratton and to develop two additional high elevation study sites, allowing us to replicate grazing treatments and vegetation and wildlife assessments implemented at Stratton.  The BLM has identified several different potential sites that are ecologically similar to Stratton.  Field staff are interested in expanding our research efforts to assist with their management needs and are eager to participate.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology At Stratton, we have established ten permanent cattle exclosures (0.4 hectares each) across 3 different pastures.  Each pasture will be grazed at the same intensity starting in 2006, but at 3 different times of the year.  Six exclosures (2 per pasture) were established in primarily mountain big sagebrush (lower elevation), and 4 exclosures are in high elevation (predominantly black sagebrush). One of two drainages in mountain big sagebrush habitat within each of the 3 pastures was burned in October 2005; each pasture contains paired burned and control exclosures.  Our assessments of vegetation within and outside exclosures (grazed and exclosed), and between paired treatments (burned and unburned controls) will allow us to better understand cattle impacts across various grazing intensities, particularly after recent managed burns. In addition, we developed a random stratified sampling design to assess wildlife habitat relationships, assessing the effects of grazing treatments and managed burns on wildlife habitat use and abundance.  We have 45 permanent 500 m transects, stratified by grazing (pasture) and burn treatments.  Along these transects we will assess greater sage-grouse habitat use (pellet transects) across seasons, songbird densities, and small mammal abundance.  We will develop similar grazing treatment pastures at the two new, but ecologically similar sites, to increase our replicates in high elevation sagebrush communities.  We will assess grazing impacts through exclosures and vegetation monitoring, and develop a similar stratified sampling design to assess sage-grouse, songbird and small mammal habitat relationship.  These additional sites are crucial to increase statistical power and enhance our ability to understand ecosystem functioning.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program Element and Goal: TERRESTRIAL, FRESHWATER AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS, #1 - Quantify and understand factors influencing patterns of temporal and spatial variability in key ecosystem components.Globally, our objectives are to assist BLM managers in understanding the effects of important management questions related to grazing and burning by assessing vegetation and wildlife responses to treatments.  We need to continue to monitor treatment effects for the first 3 years, as well as establish replicate treatments and monitoring at two additional sites, to understand how to use these management tools effectively.  More specifically, our objectives are to: 1)evaluate grazing regimes and grazing management after a prescribed burn; 2) assess the impacts of cattle and wild ungulates on vegetation abundance and composition; 3)within each grazing and burned treatment, and controls, assess greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) abundance and habitat use (permanent pellet transects), as well as songbird (point counts) and small mammal abundance (live trapping) and habitat associations; 4) evaluate changes in wildlife species presence/abundance over the past 30 years (at Stratton) to determine how current management practices (grazing and burning) are affecting wildlife populations in a sagebrush ecosystem; and 5) maintain long term research assessments to evaluate changes in the vegetation community and wildlife associations as they relate to the BLMs long-term commitment to adaptive management activities & research.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan The research is designed to meet the needs of local BLM managers, who have been active participants in the study design and planning. In the first 3 years, results from our research will provide immediate information for BLM managers.  Long-term monitoring and evaluations will address more global management questions about managed burns and grazing impacts on sagebrush steppe vegetation and associated wildlife.  Ultimately this research will directly assist with management decisions throughout sagebrush habitats in the west.  Results from this study will provide valuable information for the BLMs Sage-Grouse Habitat Conservation Strategy, the BLMs National Habitat Assessment Framework Team, and assist local field office managers with decision making processes. We will publish results from this ressearch in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Ecological Impacts of Roads and Road Use on Wildlife Populations\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The last several decades have seen a dramatic increase in both the number of vehicles on our nation's roadways and the number of miles of roadway.  Since 1960, state motor vehicle registrations have increased from 73,857,768 vehicles to 231,389,998 vehicles in 2003.  Furthermore, the total number of miles of public roads have increased from 3,545,693 miles in 1960 to 3,988,352 miles in 2003.  This creates a situation in which not only are more miles of road being created, but there are more vehicles traveling on those roadways.  In 1960, the annual vehicle distance traveled was 719,762 miles; by 2003, that number had risen to 2,890,893 miles.  In addition to passenger vehicles, the sale and use of off-highway vehicles also has skyrocketed. With the construction of new roads, increased use of motorized vehicles, and increasing dispersal of the human population to more rural areas, wildlife populations are losing habitat and being forced to navigate through temporally and spatially fragmented habitat. In turn, there has been increased wildlife mortality from a variety of sources and reduced genetic diversity.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Observations will begin with baseline monitoring under current accessibility conditions.  Monitored variables will include vehicular traffic; trail use (in select strategic places); and animal movements.  The human activity observations will drive a model that estimates frequency or probability of human presence.Elk MonitoringThis project will instrument 50 adult cow elk using collars instrumented with VHF and GPS technology.  As with any wildlife study marking every individual in the population of concern is not possible. Therefore a sample size must be determined based on biological questions to be addressed and budget available. For the questions that we will address including seasonal habitat use and movement 20  30 marked individuals is a significant number for analysis needs. (Kenward, 2001; Millspaugh, 2001)   The collars used for this project will be the Habit APT tracking system GPS/VHF collars. The collar sizes have been selected based on previous elk collaring projects conducted by the Colorado Division of Wildlife. These collars will be deployed using net gunning methodology sanctioned by CDOWs Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC).  This method was chosen to provide the best spatial distribution of the collars. These collars will automatically turn on every four hours and remain on for 180 seconds to attempt the collection of location coordinates and a value of elevation using the 12 channel GPS receiver and antenna mounted on the collar.  If a location is successfully collected or the attempt fails the GPS receiver will automatically shut off and wait for four hours before it will make another attempt.  The battery life of these collars is such that the GPS receiver will last for 3 years attempting a location acquisition every four hours leading to a potential of over 6,000 locations per animal. Data collected by these collars include time, date, x and y locational parameters, elevation, satellite information and dilution of precision metrics.  Dilution of precision metrics include horizontal, vertical and positional dilutions of precision. These metrics are important for quality control of GPS locations. The receiver used for this project, Habit Osprey model 2600, has the capability of remotely downloading the locational data on a pre-programmed routine and from up to 10 kilometers away. When the receiver is used to download there is also a current real time collar location relayed to the receiver.  In addition to the data being downloaded intermittently they are permanently stored on board the collars. Vehicle MonitoringMotorized vehicle monitoring began in August of 2004 and will continue for four years.  Sites were selected based on major study area access routes. The results for the initial year have been published as an USGS Open-File Report #2005-1349.    Pneumatic vehicle counters, which can discriminate vehicle type and speed, are used at the majority of the vehicle monitoring sites.  In addition to pneumatic counters, magnetic and infrared counters will be used as deemed necessary. Complete description of counters and the data collected are described in the above cited USGS Open-File Report.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program Element and Goal: TERRESTRIAL, FRESHWATER AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS, #3 - Develop indexes of ecosystem sensitivity to change and vulnerability to potential stressors, and tools to predict ecosystem responses to environmental change.The objective of this project is to provide simultaneous monitoring of the daily, seasonal, and annual movements of wildlife species of interest, initially elk (Cervus elaphus) while also monitoring motorized vehicle use.  Each of the monitoring efforts will provide significant information on their own. The elk location data will result in high-resolution spatial and temporal information on marked elk. This information can be used to asses various land management and wildlife management questions (e.g., the amount of time elk are spending on private lands versus public lands, number of successful highway crossings). The motorized vehicle monitoring data will provide information on vehicle speed, type, direction of travel and time and date of the event; these data can be used by land managers to assess intensity of human use, categorize it, and develop management scenarios. Together, the two datasets will provide crucial information on the relationships between elk habitat use and movements, the physical presence of roads, and use of motorized vehicles. In turn, the information will provide an objective foundation for developing models that address the impacts of roads and their use on wildlife management and a scientific basis for using traffic management as an indirect tool for wildlife management. Close collaboration with local management agencies provides options for manipulating accessibility of public lands and observing wildlife responses.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Communication with our collaborators  will be an ongoing process, involving continual consultation with the various partners in this study.  Formal technology transfers are expected at specific junctures: (1) detailed progress reports will be presented at least annually to the collaborators including Colorado Division of Wildlife, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service and National Forest Service, (2) resulting maps showing relationships between observed elk habitat use patterns and identified determinants of those patterns will be presented to appropriate land managers upon completion, (3) following development of spatially-explicit habitat use models, USGS researchers will work closely with collaborators to help them develop and evaluate scenarios of different management alternatives, and (4) results of this work will be published in a series of refereed journal articles. All basic GIS thematic layers will be available to anyone interested in them.\n",

      "\t\tAccomplishments FY10: In FY10, we again continued our monitoring on off-highway vehicle (OHV) use and elk movements and habitat use.  OHV monitoring use entailed the operation of, and bi-monthly maintenance/data down loading visits to, monitoring network which grew from 13 to 19 sites. All sites are currently operating however monitoring site vandalism is a challenge.     Monitoring of elk movements and habitat came to an end for this round of collars.  In January of 2010 we collected our last, of this round of collars, active collar.  Throughout the life of the project we have had technical issues with these collars ranging from failing to collect locations on an infrequent basis to failing to operate at all early in the collar life.  Even with these technological challenges, to date we have collected more than 40,000 locations on a total of 41 elk. Management agencies (BLM, NPS, and Colorado Division of Wildlife) are using this information as a basis for upcoming 5-year management plans.We have spent a significant amount of time during this fiscal year developing database tools and analysis tools for the data collected for this project.  One of the major hurdles in the past has been having funding for assistance with analysis.  Midway through this fiscal year we finally had some funding we could use for the analysis efforts.  With this assistance we are making significant process of evaluating the impacts of motorized use on elk movements and habitat selection.We have also deployed five 22g solar/gps PTTs on Gunnison Sage Grouse as a prototype test  and in FY11 we will begin marking Gunnison Sage Grouse in the Crawford population where we will again  be looking at the impacts of OHV use on their habitat use and movementsFY09: In FY09, we again continued our monitoring on off-highway vehicle (OHV)use and elk movements and habitat use.  OHV monitoring use entailed the operation of, and bi-monthly maintenance/data down loading visits to, monitoring network which grew from 13 to 19 sites . All sites are currently operating however monitoring site vandalism is a challenge.     Monitoring of elk movements and habitat use also continues.  Currently we have 15 elk collared with GPS/VHF collars, which attempt to collect a location in one of 3 sampling strategies (hourly, every 2hours, or every 4 hours, depending on how the collars were programmed).  Throughout the life of the project we have had technical issues with these collars ranging from failing to collect locations on an infrequent basis to failing to operate at all early in the collar life.

      "\t\tMethodology We propose to address the challenge of developing an integrated monitoring approach from multiple perspectives.  We will use existing approaches to developing monitoring programs, assessing ecosystems, and evaluating cumulative effects (e.g., CEQ 1997; Mulder et al. 1999; US EPA 2002) to provide a foundation for developing a monitoring approach focused on BLM needs.  We will use existing literature and studies to define and describe casual relations representing major pathways by which human-caused changes related to energy development affect ecosystem components in the region.  Information from the causal diagrams will be used to help identify potential key variables for assessment, to identify interactions among ecosystem components, and to determine appropriate scales for description, monitoring, and adaptive management.  We will spend time with staff and records from the White River FO and an adjacent FO (to be decided after initial meeting with project cooperators) to learn what classes of decisions are informed by monitoring, how monitoring is currently conducted (including for other purposes, e.g., grazing), what and how information is stored, and how the field offices see participating in development and implementation of monitoring programs  including the work proposed here.  We will summarize data available from existing BLM monitoring activities and identify and describe other outside sources of data (e.g., government or commercial remote sensed data) relevant to monitoring effects of energy development.  Information from these different perspectives will be combined to describe an approach for monitoring that is based on tested ideas, applicable to the region of interest, and tailored to BLM needs.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Energy development in the Intermountain West is intensifying rapidly, which may have profound affects on the region's wildlife and vegetative communities. The Mountain Plover, whose populations have declined over the last 30 years, has been proposed for, but precluded from, listing under the Endangered Species Act; thus, many natural resource agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management, and other entities list it as a species of special concern and are collaborating in their efforts to better understand which factors may be contributing to the species' decline.In Wyoming, where energy development is especially intense, there is an immediate need for information as to measures that may mitigate disturbance to mountain plovers associated with energy development and extraction. This task entails a pilot study to evaluate plover breeding populations and nesting densities in Wyoming landscapes before and after energy development, and where densities/rates of energy infrastructures/activities are low, medium and high. The results of this work will help to guide recommendations for minimizing both short- and long-term effects of energy development on this species of concern. In addition, the results will help to guide efficient and effective lease stipulations that will help to ensure viable mountain plover populations.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Habitat Prioritization for Selected Raptor Species in Wyoming\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The conservation of raptors in Wyoming is a concern to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) due to potential declines (Hoffman and Smith 2003) and impacts, and standard conservation measures for development activities to mitigate impacts to raptors are currently recommended by the Service (e.g., seasonal distance restrictions of activities relative to known roost or nest sites).  However, these measures are limited in several ways: 1) they are applied during only one season, 2) they focus only on known nest or roost sites, and 3) they do not consider other habitats such as foraging areas, unknown roost and nest sites, and movement corridors.  Identification of priority habitats for raptors in Wyoming could help address these limitations.  Modeling habitat selection based on existing raptor and habitat data could predict and map the importance of different habitats (Bustamante and Seoane 2004).  Furthermore, habitat selection modeling could also predict the location of potentially limiting habitats such as roost and nest sites, and foraging areas across the landscape.  The primary goal of the proposed project is to develop a quantitative predictive model of the relationship between available raptor habitat, and raptor habitat use for 4 species in Wyoming:  Golden Eagle, Ferruginous Hawk, Northern Harrier, and Prairie Falcon.  Our project will result in models and maps that identify priority habitat areas (Fielding and Bell 1997).  These products will assist the Service in effective raptor conservation by facilitating the prioritization of locations for strategic, and focused, conservation efforts.  This approach may also benefit development in Wyoming.  For example, the Service could adjust the current approach of systematically advocating standard, species-specific conservation measures to target habitats of high conservation value to particular species.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches can be used to support raptor conservation planning, even using coarse GIS data (Carter et al. 2009). The development of finer-scale spatially explicit Geographic Information System (GIS) habitat models requires two major data components: 1) species-specific data, and 2) habitat data.  These two suites of data are used to develop models and maps which will identify and locate priority habitats at a landscape scale (Manly et al. 2002).  We will source and compile all available location data for the species-specific data for the 4 focal species.  These data will be amalgamated into one data set and we will carry out thorough quality assurance and control examinations.  As mentioned, FORT has collected, compiled, and generated a large number of spatially explicit habitat data sets for Wyoming.  These include GIS information on vegetation types, human disturbance, environmental characteristics (e.g. moisture availability, NDVI, digital elevation models), and land use.  Currently, we have over 400 potential habitat variables across multiple scales.  Because selection can occur at multiple scales, we will compare scales to determine the most relevant features at each scale (Olivier and Wotherspoon 2005).  We will examine each habitat variable and consider its relevance to the habitat selection behavior of the focal species.  We will review existing literature and consult experts on each species to determine if potentially important habitat components do not exist in our current databases.  When possible we will acquire GIS data representing missing components to include in our modeling efforts.  We will implement a variety of modeling approaches (likely including generalized additive and linear models, and random forest approaches) to develop the best models through cross-validation and AIC approaches (Burnham and Anderson 2002).  This will produce spatially explicit GIS habitat models to provide managers with a practical tool to guide conservation planning (Osborne et al. 2001).  Studies of habitat selection at small site-specific scales further our understanding of the fine-scale biology and life history of species.  However, spatially explicit information about habitat quality at broad landscape scales is most useful for prioritizing conservation and law enforcement efforts and activities (Whitfield et al. 2006).Ultimately, the models developed will be applied to areas where we do not have species-specific data to predict spatial relationships across planning regions.  Once our initial habitat models are developed for each species, we will test the models using cross-validation techniques against independent datasets to ensure that inferences regarding habitat selection are robust.  Furthermore, we propose to field validate model output to test the predictive capabilities of the models.  The information gathered during the field validation stage will be used to refine the accuracy and precision of the models.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives 1)  Compilation and screening of all available raptor location data for the 4 focal species and all available seasons including nesting (sources: Federal Agencies, WYNDD, NGOs, WGFD).Outcome (1) will produce a complete data set containing all location information for the 4 focal species.  This dataset will form the species-specific component of our modeling and will be an important resource for any future investigations into raptor ecology and management in Wyoming.  The compiled dataset will also help identify areas where data are missing which could potentially be highlighted for future investigations.  FORT has collaborative relationships with the multiple source agencies listed above and members of this team have extensive experience in database management and compilation.  For example, as part of the Sage-grouse seasonal habitat modeling effort FORT has written programs to compile datasets from 27 different sources, including > 150,000 observations, to produce an integrated database of all Sage-grouse locations in Wyoming.2)  Collection, compilation, and generation of raptor relevant spatial habitat layers, with a focus on wind energy and associated infrastructure. Outcome (2) data will be used in the habitat modeling efforts to identify important habitat characteristics and priority habitats.  We will also compile spatial data on wind potential that will be used to identify potential wind-raptor conflict areas (Carrete et al. 2009b).  For example, we will address the question: where do high priority raptor habitat and high wind potential overlap in Wyoming?  We will also develop spatial layers and metrics representing potentially important features on the landscape such as radio towers using FAA data that includes height obstructions above 200ft.3)  Development of predictive habitat use models and maps for raptor habitats in Wyoming for the 4 focal species.Outcomes (1) and (2) will provide us with the data necessary to develop habitat use models for our 4 focal species in Wyoming.  Ultimately, the accuracy and precision of these models will be governed by data availability and quality (Brotons et al. 2004).  Good data will produce good models and accurate maps.  These models and maps can then be used as decision support tools to inform priority conservation areas for raptors and identify potential areas for future wind development conflicts.  We will address the issues of data quality and model accuracy and precision in Outcome (4).4)  Field validation of model predictions/maps.We will develop habitat use models for the 4 focal species using available data.  We are confident that we have the most thorough coverage of relevant spatial habitat layers for Wyoming.  However, we need to examine the available species-specific raptor data.  We will develop models using available data.  We will then conduct a field season to determine the accuracy and precision of those models.  If the model performs well we expect more raptors in areas identified as high probability of use, than in areas of low probability of use.  Model performance will be assessed through field surveys, and independent data.5)  A project report and manuscript for peer-reviewed publication presenting the results of this research.6)  Document of recommendations for future raptor data collection and landscape level analyses in Wyoming.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In the 21st century, communications technology and better models for citizen participation promise to increase the responsiveness of water management agencies to changing stakeholder objectives and better information about ecological and socioeconomic systems. Improved technologies for hydrologic forecasting and decision support, as well as greater confidence in these technologies, promise to enhance water management capabilities even further. Decision making and risk analysis associated with natural resource issues and projects is becoming more complex and growing in public importance. Resource management agencies are continually faced with the need for tools to help express uncertainty and in the use of methods for addressing uncertainty in decisions, to reach defensible conclusions, and to prepare documents that describe the process and reasoning that support resource decisions.  DOI resource agencies have a growing appetite to understand the various decision tools and need to know how to select the appropriate tools and fit these methods to different decision problems, such as multiple objective ranking techniques.  These resource management problems are further complicated by a diversity of scientific disciplines dealing with physical parameters, habitat, water flow, chemistry, biology, social elements, and tradeoffs needed for project planning purposes, related to changes in water management and multiple resource impacts. This research task will extract components from existing decision support systems and where needed develop other model components for inclusion in interactive decision support systems for hydrologic, hydraulic, and instream flow values. This development, analysis, and support of river, reservoir, and natural resource attributes in decision support systems will focus on being more user friendly, more interactive, and allow for results to be customized by the user(i.e., resource managers).  A dependence on familiar spreadsheet software, at least as an interface, will provide a greater level of trust and understanding to the user and thereby enhance the acceptance of individual model components for data input, data processing, and simulation.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Evaluate and review some popular and currently used decision making tool and methods for risk analysis and products from the private, agency, professional, and academic water and natural resources communities. Where methods seem appropriate, extract components from existing decision support systems; and where needed develop other new model components for inclusion in interactive decision support systems for hydrologic, hydraulic, and instream flow values.  Particular emphasis will focus on use of spreadsheets for defining functions, modifying data, performing calculations, and for presentation of results. In other applications the use of more complicated systems anlaysis and river basin models will also be applied.  Analysis of resource management tradeoffs, related to the multiple disciplines and multitude of issues included in river basin water management operations, will bring independent decision variables together in an integrated decision making process.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Terrestrial, Freshwater and Marine Ecosystems; Goal 2: Model factors controlling ecosystem patterns at various scales and develop decision support systems which integrate this information with management options.  Goal 3:  Develop indices of ecosystem sensitivity to change and vulnerability to potential stressors, and tools to predict ecosystem responses to environmental change.1.

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Working with FWS Arcata and Yreka Offices, the Systems Impact Assessment Model (SIAM), the decision support system for the Klamath River was applied to resource management issues including:1) effects of changing flow on water temperature; 2) the potential to change temperature by changing Iron Gate Reservoir release depth; 3) the potential to change water temperature by manipulating Copco and Iron Gate Reservoir storage volume; 4) the potential to alter spawn timing if the thermal regime were altered; 5) the potential to change outmigration timing; 6) the predicted effects of spring flow variability on outmigration; and 7) incremental spring flow variability and predicted effects on outmigration. Our findings, based on analysis of over 1000 SIAM simulations, have provided some insights to these resource management issues.Water temperature is a major issue for restoration of the anadromous fishery below Iron Gate Dam, CA.  Our SIAM analyses indicate that the strongest driver for water temperature remains meteorological conditions in the Klamath Basin that provide up to 6C (+ or -)of the variability in water temperature, while changing flows can  provide up to 4C (+ or -)of variability, depending upon antecedent conditions and time of year.  An analysis of simulations with a hypothetical multi-level outlet for Iron Gate Dam releases indicated that blending a surface (250 cfs) and bottom outlet release (450 cfs) for a total of 700 cfs from the Dam during the month of September in any water year, had the best potential for ameliorating water temperatures immediately below the dam by up to 4-5 C.  The potential to improve estimates of fish production by using the full active storage volume of Copco and Iron Gate Reservoirs proved to be very limited.  These reservoirs have relatively small storage capacities.  FWS asked us to simulate a) use of the total active storage in various spring and summer months, and b) attempt to determine whether the reservoirs could re-fill.  SIAM analysis indicated that only in very dry hydrological years was there a significant predicted improvement in fish production if flows were augmented in March and April.   A spreadsheet water balance model indicated that the reservoirs could potentially re-fill under hydrological conditions similar to 40 of the past 43 years of record. The potential to alter run-timing was also explored using SIAM.  Although earlier run-timing was documented for Klamath River fall Chinook salmon as recently as the 1930's, the fall run now occurs from late September through November.  SIAM simulations indicate that only if some stream temperature cooling occurred, perhaps by changing Iron Gate Dam operations or use of a multi-level outlet release structure for the Dam, could conditions be favorable for earlier spawning.The last 3 resource issues explored using SIAM are intertwined.  Augmenting spring flows, spring flow variability, and out-migration timing are issues associated with year-class strengh for fall Chinook salmon in the Klamath River.  YOY fish begin to emerge and swim up beginning as early as January and February in warm, low-flow years.  Rearing habitat and onset of disease transmission when temperatures increase to 10 C and higher appear to be the major bottlenecks for salmon recruitment in the Klamath based on SIAM simulation results.  In years when flows in the range of 3500 to 4500 cfs can be released from Iron Gate Dam in April and May, a positive increase in fish production estimates in the SIAM model occur.  In some very dry years, rearing habitat limitation resulting from low flows, appears to be the greatest limitation to fish production.  In some very wet years, particularly when fall and winter runoff events occur in excess of 8000 - 10,000 cfs, spawning habitat and egg incubation losses may preclude a strong year class of fall Chinook salmon.\n",

Application enhancements, as well as troubleshooting and training, are required on an intermittent basis and on a more sustained basis as specific proposals are funded.  This task may involve, but is not limited to, several specific FORT software products, including SIAM, SALMOD, SNTEMP, and SSTEMP. It will also involve assisting DOI (or DOI funded) clients with assessments, peer review and referral.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology More detail, including downloadable FORT-developed software and users manuals, for the specific software products we will support may be found at the following locations:SIAM: http://www.fort.usgs.gov/Products/Software/SIAM/SALMOD: http://www.fort.usgs.gov/Products/Software/SALMOD/SNTEMP and SSTEMP: http://www.fort.usgs.gov/Products/Software/SNTEMP/\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Fisheries and Aquatic Resources: Goal 5. Develop research and technology tools to provide the scientific basis for developing adaptive management strategies and evaluating their effectiveness for restoration efforts to sustain aquatic resources.  Task objectives:1. Modify the Systems Impact Assessment Model (SIAM) (originally developed for use on the Klamath River, Oregon and California) for application in other watersheds.  Meeting the objective will involve crafting a generic approach to water quantity, water quality, and fish production modeling, with possible additions of channel change, sediment budget, or similar applications, still in a decision support framework.2. Predict impacts on flow and temperature alteration on  fish production.It is likely that resource managers will want assistance in developing water management alternatives related to meeting fish recovery goals on the Sacramento, San Joaquin, San Juan, and other rivers. We will describe flow and water temperature regimes -- as evaluated by SALMOD or other models -- predicted to increase fish production at various time scales.  Model applications will have the goal of data assessment, and specifically understanding the effects that altered flow and water temperature regimes, or hatchery augmentation, have on sustained production for recovery goals.3. Provide bug fixes, on line training, and technical assistance for applications of the The Stream Network Temperature Model (SNTEMP) and the Stream Segment Temperature Model (SSTEMP). These widely used models  predict how water temperature changes in rivers as flows, streamside shading, and/or the physical characteristics (e.g., width) of the river are altered and have received continuous support at FORT for the last two decades and are gradually being superseded by other models with more contemporary interfaces.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan With respect to the three task objectives:1.  We will proceed with prototype products such as WRRAT and SalREP, to provide both software and user documentation, that will be made available to prospective users.  When sufficient work is complete to wrap up an interim product, an open file report will be created for broader distribution.  2.  This type of modeling assessment typically results in an open file report and journal article, the latter being a summary of the former.  Intermittent progress reports and presentations are generally required. In addition, the model itself (software and data sets) will be provided to the client.  Metadata will be formulated.3. The primary form of communication for temperature modeling support will continue to be ongoing telephone and e-mail assistance.  The secondary form will be updating the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) listings maintained on the FORT website.  Occasionally, new software or utility releases are also made available on the website.  The audience for these products is diverse, including state and federal agencies (USGS, FWS, EPA, water quality control boards, state fish and wildlife groups, private consultants, & universities).

Understanding the effects of management actions and limiting factors, continual improvement and expansion of biological data collection, mathematical and statistical analyses, and simulation modeling will be used to estimate and predict salmon populations and habitat quantity and quality.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology GS is guiding FWS and the Yurok, Karuk and Hoopa Valley tribal fishery programs to collect biological and habitat data needed to better estimate young-of-year production and successful outmigration, and habitat selection and use rates.  In turn, this data and information will be used to calibrate and improve estimates from USGS' SALMOD, a young-of-year salmon production model. We use procedures developed for sampling Klamath River habitats, densities and populations started in 1997 with continued development to date. Reservoir releases were very low in 2001 through 2005, devastatingly high in 2006, and low again in 2007 and 2009. Our production data are almost solely for dry or extremely dry water years with low, declining escapement and young-of-year production. We are anxious to continue this model calibration effort during average and wet water years with pre-2004 above average salmon adult escapement.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Need to better understand, communicate, predict and control the effects of water and river management actions on salmonid species; recognize flow-timing related limiting factors; reduce bias, improve precision and optimize sampling effort of USFWS and tribal fisheries program biological data collection efforts; assess habitat restoration efforts; and reverse the ongoing decline of Federal species.FAER 5- Develop research and technology tools to provide the scientific basis for developing adaptative management strategies and evaluating their effectiveness for restoration efforts to sustain aquatic resources.FAER 6- Provide research support and technical assistance... to support natural resource management problem solving and decision making.S&T - Goal 2: Develop and evaluate inventory and monitoring methods, protocols, experimental designs, analytic tools, models, and technologies to measure biological status and trends.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Progress will be presented each January to the agency and tribal Klamath River flow study team (headed by FWS' Arcata Fishery Program Leader).  That presentation describes what data have been collected, what improvements have been made and proposes data collection for the upcoming year. After nine years of exceedingly low releases, high disease mortality, dramatic fish kills, and declining escapement, we have collected data insufficient to calibrate SALMOD for Klamath River productivity.  The model was useful for identification and estimation of aquatic habitat limitations, both spatial and temporal, on chinook salmon production in the Trinity River Flow Evaluation (1999), but not in a situation as dramatically non-average as the Klamath River in 2001 to 2009.  With proposed flows inserted, the calibrated model is being used by fishery biologists from FWS, the Karuk, Yurok and Hoopa Valley tribes and is available to the Bureau of Reclamation, National Marine Fisheries Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Interior Solicitors Office to evaluate flow regimes to enhance salmon young-of-year production after dam removal.  Besides statistical and numerical analyses of biological data, products will include scientific publications which discuss important findings; technical assistance; and a simulation software package ready for reasoned use by FWS. With agreement from the California/Nevada Office and Arcata Fish and Wildlife  Office (who supported funding this work through the Science Support Program), GS work in 2009 (beyond continuing biological data collection) focuses on publication of the backlog of data and analyses. BR's Trinity Restoration Program has funded GS to assist with renovating SALMOD and applying it to the Trinity River (where it was developed).   Biological sampling and data compilation will be done in close working relationship between the principal investigator and the Arcata Fishery Program Leader (AFPL) or designee.  GS and the AFPL will continue to piggyback funding from several concurrent tasks to accomplish this work.  The sampling work will be done by biologists and technicians from the FWS and the Karuk and Yurok tribes.  Sampling for Task A: adult fish (i.e., successfully spawned females) and Task B: estimating production numbers and size of fry and pre-smolts will be accomplished by on-site coordination, guidance and technical supervision from USGS.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The first-ever Chinook salmon carcass survey on the mid-Klamath River below Iron Gate Dam was conducted in October-December, 2001.   The concurrent redd count was 825 redds while the carcass survey estimate of successfully spawned females in the same stretch of river was 2480.   Similar 1:3+ results were found in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006.   Redd counts continue to be used for large area-low density sampling while carcass surveys estimates replace redd count estimates in high density spawning areas.  Rotary trap and frame net surveys of exiting pre-smolts have been conducted since 2000 with an intense effort started in 2002, contemporaneous with three years of very low releases from Iron Gate Dam.  Efficiency estimates in low flows have shown that expensive rotary traps do a poor job of sampling versus the low-tech and much more reliable frame nets fished near the rotary traps.   At low flows (from 1300 to 1700 cfs in two months of the spring of 2002, 2004, and 2005), young-of-year salmon stopped moving and the disease symptom rate (starting in late April) jumped dramatically to 70%. Drought (2001 to present except 2006; following five wet years), court-mandated minimum flows (2002 to present) and release management (2001 to present) have coincided with a dramatic decline of fall Chinook salmon young-of-year production and outmigration and following years' returning adults.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Integrating variable location, geospatial scale, and economic impacts into decision support systems for managing natural resources.\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Decision Support Systems developed by FORT scientists have been specific or hard-wired for one location, often limited in geospatial scale, and lacking an economic impact or land use component.  Continuing development of decision support systems for natural resources management should be enhanced in these critical areas and take advantage of  new hardware and software technology.  Multiple use benefits for natural resources are now a central tenent for complex environmental decision making to meet stakeholder demands.  Strategic planning, adaptive management and re-operation efforts are facilitated by decision support system models and tools that provide information to managers and stakeholders that allow them to make more informed decisions about multiple use benefits.  Future development of  DSS models and tools will be based on providing objective, quantitative, information and analysis capability to resource management decision making processes.  Periodic planning by managers and stakeholders utilizing these models and tools will allow participants to become fully informed regarding the options, tradeoffs, allocations, or sharing of shortages in natural resource benefits among various use needs.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology DSS models and tools development for the future will focus on adding economic components to reflect the costs of implementing natural resource management objectives.  Cost estimates may be a simple as a change in rates, or as complex as a region-wide economic analysis tool that calculates revenue losses or gains in a wide-variety of natural resources benefits to management agencies and stakeholder groups.Any Where  and Any Issue DSS models and tools are the future goal for FORT scientists.  If we develop a DSS model or tool that has a wide-variety of application geographically or can incorporate a widely divergent issue set, then these decision making support tools then can be compared between applications for certain common parameters.  Inter-application comparisons will provide ways to evaluate models and tools for robustness and improve the science for all.GIS capability using ARC-View or ARCInfo will be added to DSS models and tools that have already been developed such as SIAM for the Klamath Basin or ERAS for the Green/Yampa Basin and as appropriately determined, become an integral part of new DSS models and tools developed at FORT.Examples of new technologies that are available to upgrade/update existing model proliferate.  Most current models and tools are FORTRAN-language based and could benefit from language conversion to C++ or Visual Basic.  The graphics library for SIAM is no longer supported and cannot be changed or enhanced.  A new graphics library that is supported and widely used is required.  New DSS models and tools should take advantage of new operating system platforms and enable faster, easier upgrades as technology continues to change.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Terrestrial, Freshwater and Marine Ecosystems; Goal 2: Model factors controlling ecosystem patterns at various scales and develop decision support systems which integrate this information with management options.1)DSS models and tools will have an economic component associated with hydrological or land use changes for a geographical location.  Such issues as lost power revenues, agricultural losses, the general economy of the area,  county tax base, goods and services, cattle/dairy or other farming revenue, timber or mineral mining provide a partial list of potential economic factors.2)Rather than being specific to a particular geographic location, DSS models and tools should be generic in the sense that they can be applied to any location,, river basin, watershed, or stream reach.  Development of models and tools that can address complex environmental issues in regulated or unregulated streams, address hydropower or navigation or both, incorporate watershed, upland or riparian issues, characterize aquatic and terrestrial organism needs, and include stream, reservoir, lakes, riparian or upland habitat for these biota, and water quality and public health issues will be developed as part of this study.3)A geospatial component that can describe effects of land use change, climate change or changes in precipitation and runoff patterns must be incorporated into the modeling and tool set for DSS in the future.  In many cases, GIS-based models proliferate in the natural resources management, but they may lack true predictive capability, and be static, rather than dynamic in nature without mechanistic models of  hydrology, biology or water quality changes in response to seasonal or annual patterns.  FORT scientists would like to add GIS to some existing DSS models and tools to give better representation of landscape scale changes, effects, or results.4)FORT scientists intend to take advantage of technology improvements to move existing DSS models and tools into the future.  Examples of this include converting or upgrading models and tools to Windows XP or future operating systems, implementing new graphics libraries in various user interfaces, upgrading installation software, purchasing or utilizing new compilers as needed, and converting DOS or FORTRAN based programs in C++ or Visual Basic language.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem As the need for incorporating biological objectives into water management has grown, so has the need for well defined mechanisms for translating biological information into currencies and paradigms usable by water managers. Development of methods and metrics to describe and predict relevant biological information in a decision support environment are needed. Concepts being elaborated include aquatic habitat patch dynamics, improved definition of the needs of aquatic biota, and trade-offs between different biotic and abiotic variables in a time sensitive dynamic environment. When research and development activities in these subject areas are conducted in watersheds where important water management decisions are planned, the R&D activities must be balanced with client needs for timely information  to meet management decision deadlines.  This task involves the coupling of reservoir operations and flow routing models with habitat response models to determine feasibility, risk, and effectiveness of various management alternatives. Portions of this task involve innovative development of spatially explicit habitat response methods and models and the metrics used to interpret them.  An additional aspect of water management, water rights, can involve the evaluation of benefits of water provided to habitat in the stream in comparison to benefits for traditional out-of-stream uses. The tools developed in this project can be applied to both situations.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will collaborate closely with client groups, stakeholders, and other USGS Centers to develop and synthesize information needed to quantify the consequences of water management alternatives. Synthesis may involve several or all of the following components:(a) Integration of reservoir operations and flow routing models typically used in strategic planning and day-to-day operations by the water management agency. (b) Temperature modeling, including data acquisition, model testing, calibration, and simulation, assisting other entities involved in temperature modeling, and/or developing methods to incorporate temperature information developed elsewhere into a managerial decision environment.(c) Development of spatially explicit functional relationships between discharge and habitat metrics for a variety of biological responses at scales ranging from individual life stages to habitat use guilds to entire communities. Habitat metrics may include both suitability of hydraulic conditions (depth and velocity), spatial constraints (e.g., shoreline habitat, hyporheic zones), and temporal stability (patch persistence). Development of these habitat metrics may involve data collection and 2-d hydraulic modeling, mesohabitat classification, and/or development of hydraulic habitat classification tables.(d) Acquisition and synthesis of information related to other resources and values that may be affected by alternative water management scenarios, such as changes in flood frequency and magnitude, effects on reservoir storage, drought contingencies, and spills, changes in hydropower production, and deliveries of contractual water to downstream users.(e) Development of methods and materials for concise display of information on all affected resource values in an easily understood format.(f) Development of reference materials, user documentation, and training to enable client groups and stakeholder groups to analyze and troubleshoot management scenarios on their own.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Interactions between native and non-native aquatic species in the southwestern U.S.\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The southwestern U.S. is home to a variety of rare and endemic fishes. Recovery methods for native fish within the southwest have included physical habitat restoration; native fish stocking; barrier construction; renovation of isolated habitats; and predator removal. To assist recovery and management efforts, USGS-BRD is working with state and federal agencies to conduct research related to life history and ecology of native fish; their habitat; their interactions with introduced species; and the effectiveness of restoration efforts. Problems related to current and future studies are described below.Small-bodied Predatory Fish Impacts:Recovery programs in the Colorado River basin are spending more than a million dollars a year to remove primarily large game fish from mainstem habitats. However more numerous, small bodied predators, may also be contributing to losses of rare species. Earlier studies (Mueller and Burke 2000) suggest removal efforts may affect predator year-class distribution more than overall standing crop. Research is needed to determine the role of small-bodied introduced fish predation, including non-game species, on native fish recovery.Crayfish Impacts:Crayfish are not native to the Colorado River Basin (CRB), yet they are now established throughout the region. Orconectes virilis is the most widespread crayfish in the CRB. This species is polytrophic, and there is some evidence that it can negatively impact aquatic ecosystems through competitive and predatory interactions. There is also evidence that crayfish burrowing and feeding activity cause habitat degradation. Further research is needed to evaluate impacts of crayfish on habitat and populations of southwestern native fish.Barrier Evaluation:Many recovery plans for federally listed fishes state that barrier construction and pisicide application should be considered and evaluated as a method for protecting existing populations from non-native fish contamination. Consideration of barriers is a reasonable starting point for fish recovery planning as barriers have been used as a management tool to enhance populations of native fishes throughout the southwest for decades. Renovation projects based on barriers are conceptually simple: a potential fish barrier is identified or constructed, undesirable fish in the area isolated by the barrier are removed, and the renovated area is restocked with native fish exhibiting desirable genetic characteristics. This conceptual simplicity bears little relationship tothe technical and institutional challenges of actually implementing a successful barrier project. Specific field research plans for evaluating individual barriers will be developed following guidelines in Carpenter and Terrell (2005) in order to improve the process of planning and evaluating barrier/renovation projects.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Objective 1. Test 9 potential predators of razorback larvae (adult threadfin shad, red shiner, and fathead minnow; age-1 yellow bullhead; and age-0 rainbow trout, common carp, channel catfish, green sunfish, and bluegill) in an aquaria setting.Objective 2. Annual production of O. virilis and fish was calculated using density and biomass estimates. Gut contents and stable isotope analysis was used to examine trophic ecology of crayfish and fish in two creeks in Arizona. Gut content analysis followed procedures outlined by Guan and Wiles (1998). Sample collection for SIA of all organisms followed methods of Whitledge and Rabeni (1997). Fin clip samples from fish were prepared following methods recommended by the Colorado Plateau Stable Isotope Laboratory at Northern Arizona University.    An experiment was conducted to examine assimilation efficiency of crayfish. The control treatment was crayfish fed only bloodworms for the rest of the experiment. Treated crayfish were fed rainbow trout eggs for one week, and then crayfish were returned to a diet of bloodworms for 28 days. Crayfish were randomly selected and sacrificed to examine changes in their stable isotope signature (SIS) as their diets changed. SIA data obtained from Day 1- 28 provide retention time information. Objective 3. Publish (in refereed outlet) criteria for inclusion of barrier and renovation projects; used a variety of sources to compile information on barriers and renovations; summarized and compiled information; provided example criteria for measuring ecological success of restoration projects.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Objective 1 (Predator - Prey Studies Concerning Razorback Sucker and Introduced Fishes): Abstract from paper published in Southwestern Naturalist: The razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus), an endangered big-river fish of the Colorado River basin, has demonstrated no sustainable recruitment in 4 decades, despite presence of spawning adults and larvae. Lack of adequate recruitment has been attributed to several factors, including predation by nonnative fishes. Substantial funding and effort has been expended on mechanically removing nonnative game fishes, typically targeting large predators. As a result, abundance of larger predators has declined, but the abundance of small nonnative fishes has increased in some areas. We conducted laboratory experiments to determine if small nonnative fishes would consume larval razorback suckers. We tested adults of three small species (threadfin shad, Dorosoma petenense; red shiner, Cyprinella lutrensis; fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas) and juveniles of six larger species (common carp, Cyprinus carpio; yellow bullhead, Ameiurus natalis; channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus; rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss; green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus; bluegill, L. macrochirus). These nonnative fishes span a broad ecological range and are abundant within the historical range of the razorback sucker. All nine species fed on larval razorback suckers (total length, 916 mm). Our results suggest that predation by small nonnative fishes could be responsible for limiting recovery of this endangered species. Objective 2 (Impacts of introduced crayfish on native fishes within the Colorado River Basin): Highlights of analysis of crayfish gut contents: The most common food item in terms of both relative abundance and frequency of occurrence was green plant material. It was found in 72.7% of all crayfish in Sabino and in 93.2% of all crayfish from Boneyard. Unidentified animal matter was more common in crayfish from Boneyard Creek, and in crayfish sampled at night. Macroinvertebrates were found in 34% of all crayfish from Sabino and 21% of all crayfish from Boneyard. The most common macroinvertebrates found in crayfish from both sites were coleopterans, dipterans (primarily chironomids and simuliids), and trichopterans.Objective 3 (Summary of design criteria and long-term performance of barrier projects in southwestern US): From Conclusions of Final Report: Nearly 39% of the 49 southwestern barrier and renovation projects that were amenable to assessment were compromised in less than 3 years. However, 35% were effective at keeping natives populations free of non-natives for 10 years or more. Although the ideal goal of barriers and renovations is to preserve long-term functioning of natural processes, it is important that we consider the significant success of even temporarily saving an evolutionary significant unit (ESU) from extirpation. When non-natives are an immediate threat to the survival of native fish, isolating native fish with barriers and/or renovations is often the only feasible technology available to protect these populations in their native habitat. We believe that barriers and renovations will be more effective for promoting recovery of threatened and endangered fish if an adaptive management approach, as outlined in this report, is utilized.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem With 207 methods available to establish environmental flows (Tharme, 2004) Federal and State agencies struggle with deciding which method to use that is suitable for the type of problem being addressed. Furthermore, the objective (s) for these agencies have evolved from single resources to maintaining stream integrity. Biological responses to flow metrics are widely variable.  The Hydrological Intregity Process (HIP) has been developed for New Jersy and is being developed for Missouri and Massachusetts and could be adapted to any state.  HIP calculates 171 hydrologic indices (based on individual state stream flow data)using the Hydrological Intregity Tool.  The most relevant of these indicies need to be identifed and made more easily appliable to other states using standard flow data collected at USGS gage sites.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Objective 1 - -Identify the least hydrologically altered gaging stations and time periods for a selected state. -Calculate the values for the 171 indices and classify streams into distinct stream types using a clustering approach based on the un-weighted pair group method analysis (UPGMA = average-linkage method). PCA and correlation analysis will be used in combination to reduce redundancy and identify those hydrologic attributes that account for the greatest amount of variability and that the groups are fairly independent will be done using a jackknifing or Monte - carlo approach) or by just comparing cluster output among a number of similar clustering techniques. A series of Principal Components Analyses will be done on each cluster group separately to identify the most significant indices that are associated with 10 sub-components of the flow regime (magnitude  low, average, high; frequency  low, high; duration  low, high; timing  low, high; rate  of change  average) for each of the stream types. A matrix wll be be produced that identifies, for each stream type, the indices that are most significant for each of the 10 sub-components of the flow regime based on the PCA  --that is, those variables that load highest on the 1-4th principle components (number of significant PC's will vary for each stream class based on post-hoc evaluation of PC's using Scree plots or Monte carlo test etc.). In addition, surrogate indices will be identified, that is, other indices within each sub-component will be are collinear with the indices of interest.-Develop the stream classification tool and hydrologic assessment programs specifically for the Texas and other states as funding becomes available.Objective 2 - -Conduct training for Federal and State agencies on how to use the computer programs noted above.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Engineered river channel evaluation\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem River Channels that have been previously altered by projects such as highway construction offer opportunities to redesign and engineer the channel to solve specific biological problems.  This task uses predictive models based on physical process to design channel alterations to solve biological and water management problems.Applications include development and monitoring of channel alterations to reduce Whirling Disease, an afflication of young salmonid fishes, that is caused by the microscopic myxozoan parasite Myxobolus cerebralis. The life cycle of M. cerebralis is complex and cannot be completed unless the aquatic oligochaete Tubifex tubifex is present. Where Tubifex habitat is limited, young fish carry a reduced parasite load and many survive to reproductive age. Brinkhurst (1996) suggested that modifying flow regimes to reduce sediment deposits that serve as oligochaete habitat could help reduce WD infection levels in rivers. This project will use a case study approach in cooperation with state agencies to provide a scientific foundation foridentifying flow regimes and channel modifications to reduce Tubifex habitat in previously engineered channels.  Stream habitat information for management purposes is often sought in circumstances where time and manpower resources are limited. The US Forest Service has asked that the Poudre River whirling disease study site be used to characterize winter habitat conditions where the stream is subject to ice cover. Extension of studies in this designed channel to evaluate winter fish habitat will utilizes the extensive survey grade bathymetric data already collected at the site leading to a more complete study of both summer and winter effects of the channel modifications.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Flow under total ice cover was simulated in a section of the Cache la Poudre River, Colorado as part of a study designed to quantify aquatic habitat under winter conditions. Ice cover of 60 cm was measured over pools. Ice frozen across the entire channel surface and attached to the bed at the sides was found to form a \"flow tube\" between the bottom of the ice and the bed. Habitat for Brown Trout was found to be primarily confined to the pools and a few deep runs. The literature presents a wide range of conditions suitable for winter survival so this study used a similar range of criteria to quantify habitat. The amount of available habitat increases with discharge provided the discharge is maintained long enough that the ice cover adjusts to the flow (a key assumption in the simulations performed in this study).A procedure has been developed to show how sediment limits can be used to select flow needs that improve the physical habitat for trout in rivers with whirling disease infestations.The River2D model has been shown to be able to describe extremely low flow conditions in alluvial stream due to the use of a simplified ground water model as its vehicle for managing edge wetting. Gross groundwater transmissivity can be adjusted as a calibration parameter allowing spatially intermittent surface flow to be connected by areas of hyporheic flow. This capability permits realistic simulation of low flow conditions in gravel bed streams.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Limnology & Stream Ecology\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Impounding Western rivers has created complex and highly regulated riverine ecosystems that represent a serious departure from the natural river systems that existed prior to European settlement.  Increasing urbanization and changing needs for water resources has shifted management of regulated systems toward multi-purpose uses and balancing user needs with a limited water supply.  Reservoirs such as Flaming Gorge, WY & UT provide a multi-purpose water supply impoundment that has water for hydropower, irrigation, recreation, municipal water supply, and aquatic and terrestrial native species life-cycle needs.  Flaming Gorge is an example of a reservoir having multi-zonal limnological characteristics. DSS tools, such as a satellite-based surface reflectance and cholorphyll concentration model,will illustrate the need to understand and predict important water quality assessments with TMDL goals based on reservoir water quality parameters to protect water resources, fisheries, recreation and aesthetics, in Flaming Gorge.  EPA is planning a rotating schedule to monitor the nation's waters (Survey of the Nation's Lakes).  Next year, 2007, the nation's lakes, reservoirs, and ponds will be monitored.  The purpose of the survey is to provide a regional and national summary of the lake conditions to congress and to the public.  The national lake survey will occur every 5 years, with different lakes sampled each time.EPA is currently determining what to parameters to monitor and how to do it.  Once the protocols are decided this year, each state will then be responsible to get their lakes and reservoirs sampled next summer.  The states get $8,000 per lake to survey, and it is up to the states to decide who will conduct the monitoring.  EPA has already randomly selected the 1,000 lakes and reservoirs to be sampled throughout the lower 48 states.  There are 30 of them in Colorado.  The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is looking for information on these 30 lakes.  There is a possibility that USGS may be able to provide monitoring services on these lakes either directly or in cooperation with an NGO such as the Colorado Lake and Reservoir Management Association.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Methods Used to Process Landsat Imagery for the Flaming Gorge Project1.  Create a mask of water-only pixels by extracting values of 15 or less from band 5.  Added known turbid water and subtracted land shadows.2.  Create a homogeneous 6-band water-only image by removing pixels of suspended sediment, sun glint, and anything that did not represent the banding pattern in the image.  3.  Define the striping pattern in the image with a 101x1 low-pass filter that removed high spatial frequency information.  Extend the data along the image lines with a line-oriented low-pass filter.4.  Generate a striping correction image using a 1x33 high-pass filter over the previous image to identify the banding pattern between scan swaths, followed by a 31x1 low-pass filter to suppress artifacts created by the high-pass filter.  The result is a striping correction image.5.  Subtractthe striping correction image from the image containing only reservoir pixels.  6.  Run a 5x5 pixel average over the destriped image and used the output pixel values for the regression.  This increases the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 5 but also causes some spatial patterns to blur.7.  Transform GPS-collected field sample data using known points in a digital orthophoto and respective points on the image.  Total and individual RMS should be less than one image pixel.8.  Use the GPS-collected data points to extract pixel values from the respective image for use in the regression analysis.9.  The regression equation should be appplied to the 5x5 pixel average image and values converted back to units of ug/liter from log-normal values used in the regression.This procedure is taken from:Crippen, R.

This is to minimize drift between taking the water sample and recording the GPS location.Place a filter in the filter holder with the ruff side of the filter facing up on the filter holder.Attach the filter holder to the tubing.  Make sure all connections are snug to prevent pumped water from leaking.  Shake/mix the 2-liter container and measure 1000 ml of sample water into one of the 1-liter measure containers.  Pump the 1000 ml of sample water through the filter.If it is suspected that the filter will clog before all of the sample is pumped through the filter - measure this volume and record - if all 1000 ml of sample water is pumped through the filter record the 1000 ml).Remove the filter paper from the holder, fold in half with the use of the tweezers, and forcefully blot out remaining water on clothing.Put the sample in one of the two envelops for that sample site.  The envelope should be labeled with:a.  Site nameb.  Datec.  Latitude/Longitude coordinates with datum (WGS84)d.  Volume of water that was actually pumped through the filter.e.

In 2006 the reservoir water surface elevation will be increased by aproximately 20', allowing collection the final data set needed to complete the study (test the hypothesis that water surface elevation is the major driver for magnitude, spatial extent, and duration of the annual cyanobacterial bloom).  Observation of reservoir conditions indicates that this may be true, but the conclusion must be supported or refuted by study results.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The bonytail (Gila elegans) and razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus) are endemic to the Colorado River and represent two of the four endangered, large-river fishes. A recovery program was started in 1987 for the purpose of recovering the bonytail, humpback chub, and Colorado pikeminnow, and to prevent the listing of the razorback sucker. Unfortunately, human intervention has failed to recover these fish, let-alone slow their population decline. Today, wild bonytail are extirpated from the mainstem. The razorback sucker was listed in 1991, less than 1,000 wild razorback sucker remain and juveniles are absent in the mainstem river and its reservoirs.The bonytail and razorback sucker are unique in their ability to spawn in both flowing and standing water. Predator removal and control in the mainstem river has not resulted in the recovery of these fish. More than $5 million has been spent to remove more than 1.5 million predators yet treated areas are rapidly recolonized. Native populations are at all-time lows; there is no evidence to suggest predator removal efforts have benefited native populations (Mueller 2005). Alternatives to predator removal in the mainstem river, such as development of sanctuary ponds free of predators, need to be evaluated.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Objective 1. Existing small ponds will be examined for suitability. We will assess what expertise and resources are available for development and help coordinate among agencies. Objective 2. We will work with the management agencies and other participating partners to salvage, renovate, stock native fish into potential sanctuaries. Methods may include salvaging natives via electroshocking, minnow traps, and trammel nets; chemical renovation (e.g., rotenone and antimycin); removing excess aquatic plants with herbicides; adding brush piles for fish cover; restoring water quality via water pumping or installation of aerators.Objective 3. Monitoring plans will be developed and initiated for each sanctuary. Monitoring parameters will include water quality; bathymetry; and fish, aquatic plant, and zooplankton community composition. Other factors may be added as they are determined to be important for optimizing chances for survival and recruitment.Objective 4. New research projects related to effective sanctuary management will be developed by coordinating with other participating agencies and determining gaps in critical information necessary for effective sanctuary management.Objective 5. Conditioning and testing will be conducted at the FWSs culturing facility at Achii Hanyo, near Parker Arizona. Flow acclimation will take place over a 10 week period in modified rectangular (4 x 24) tanks equipped with a screened end and an electric tolling motor. Flow conditioning will expose fish to flowing conditions 8 hrs/day. Water velocities will be ramped up from 0.05 m/s to 0.25 m/s over the course of the exercise period. Control fish will be held in similar tanks but will not be subjected to current. A minimum of 100 control and 100 treatment fish will be divided into 10 tests runs of 20 fish each (10 control-10 treatment) and exposed to large predators in a 21-ft tank. The surviving 8-13 fish will be removed to determine which group suffered the lowest predation rate.      At the end of the 10 week period, ten fish from each test group will be placed in a large 21 diameter tank that contains 5 large predators (flathead catfish or largemouth bass). These fish will be observed until the predators have eaten 8 to 13 of the test fish. At that time, surviving prey will be removed and examine to determine what test group they belonged to. A total of ten tests will be conducted.    The study will also include a minimum of 50 flow chamber experiments, testing the swimming stamina of 25 control and 25 treatment fish. A final report will be written and submitted to FWS.    A flow chamber will be used to measure the swimming stamina of both test groups. Fish will be acclimated to flow (0.5 BL/s) for 60 minutes and then subjected to velocity increases of 0.50 body lengths/sec for 30 minute intervals until the fish collapses from exhaustion. A minimum of 25 fish from each test group will be individually tested.Objective 6. We will use high resolution cameras to take aerial photographs of spawning fish. We are developing the flight protocols that identify the most appropriate flight elevation, air speed, and camera settings necessary for the best image resolution and spacing necessary to do fish counts. The same approach in protocol development is being used for surface boat counts. We are using GPS and night lighting techniques to help develop methods of visually measuring fish densities.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Objectives 1 - 3: All field work was completed in 2009. Eleven of 12 sites had razorback sucker and/or bonytail. The 11 sites varied in suitability, although bonytail and razorback sucker populations appeared to tolerate a wide range of water quality conditions. Both species spawned and recruited nearly every year in Davis Cove, which was free of non-native fish throughout the study period. Condition indices of both species were favorably comparable to values observed in other similar habitats within the basin. The razorback suckers in Office Cove showed no evidence of recruitment, and growth of individuals was slow. Water quality parameters in Office Cove of concern included high pH and high levels of selenium and cyanobacteria. The site appeared free of non-natives. Bonytail in Parker Dam Pond successfully spawned within three months of stocking and each year thereafter. Most water quality parameters were excellent at Parker DP, although low dissolved oxygen levels have been observed. Low zooplankton densities and chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations indicated food resources may be limiting. Non-native game fish were found in Three Fingers Lake in 2007, two months after it had been stocked with razorback sucker. Sampling in early 2009 indicated that the adult razorback sucker were surviving and in good condition, but we found no evidence of recruitment. Dissolved oxygen at Three Fingers Lake was still a concern. Six sites were either urban or on golf courses. Bonytail spawned and recruited in at least 3 of 5 golf course ponds, but razorback sucker did not appear to spawn. Non-native fish invaded several ponds. Partial fish kills occurred in 2 golf course ponds in 2009. High temperatures, shallow depths, and algal blooms were a concern in these ponds. Objective 5: Physical Acclimation Studies. Summary from OFR: Hatchery-reared juvenile, <25-cm TL (total length), razorback suckers appeared curious and showed no sign of predator avoidance when initially placed with large (>45-cm TL) flathead catfish. Predator-nave juveniles (20- to 25-cm TL) exhibited no discernable preference when provided areas with and without (52 percent and 48 percent, n = 16 observations; 46 percent and 54 percent, n = 20 observations) large flathead catfish. However, once predation occurred, use of predator-free areas nearly doubled in two trials (36 percent and 64 percent, n = 50 observations; 33 percent and 67 percent, n = 12 observations). A more stringent test examining available area indicated predator-savvy razorback suckers used predator-free areas (88 percent, n = 21) illustrating predator avoidance was a learned behavior. Razorback suckers exercised (treatment) in water current (<0.3 m/s) for 10 weeks exhibited greater swimming stamina than unexercised, control fish. When exercised and unexercised razorback suckers were placed together with large predators in 2006, treatment fish had significantly fewer (n = 9, z = 1.69, p = 0.046) mortalities than control fish, suggesting increased stamina improved predator escape skills. Predator/prey tests comparing razorback suckers that had been previously exposed to a predation event with control fish, found treatment fish also had significantly fewer losses than predator-nave fish (p = 0.017). Similar tests exposing predator-savvy and predator-nave bonytail with largemouth bass showed a similar trend; predator-savvy bonytail suffered 38 percent fewer losses than control fish. However, there was not a statistically significant difference between the test groups (p = 0.143) due to small sample size. All exercise and predator exposure trials increased the survival rate of razorback sucker and bonytail compared to untreated counterparts.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments Objectives 1-3: Native fish sanctuaries or repositories have been established at 11 of 12 sites: Cibola High Levee Pond, Davis Cove, Emerald Canyon Golf Course Ponds (3), Mohave Community College Pond, Needles Golf Course Ponds (2); Office Cove, Parker Dam Pond, and Three-Finger Lake.  Natural reproduction and recruitment continued for both razorback sucker and bonytail at Davis Cove and for bonytail at Parker Dam Pond. Detailed monitoring was accomplished at 12 sites.  Monitoring activities included yearly or quarterly monitoring on water quality (major ions, chlorophyll, zooplankton, nutrients, metals); fish population health (condition, reproduction, recruitment success of natives; occurrence of non-natives; bathymetric data; hourly water temperature data; mapping and identification of aquatic vegetation. As of July 2012, a final report was drafted, undergone peer-review, and is in final editing before submittal to EPN as a USGS SIR.Objective 5: The final report was published as an OFR: Mueller, G.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Engineered wetland evaluation\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Loss of critical wetland and riparian habitat due to depletion of already scarce water resources for municipal and agricultural development is an increasingly severe problem impacting biodiversity in the arid western U.S.  Water depletion through diversion and groundwater pumping threaten a wide range of wetland and riparian dependent fish and wildlife resources including federally and State listed Threatened and Endangered species and Species of Concern and will likely worsen with climate change impacts.  Often the only water available for protecting, restoring, creating, or mitigating wetland and riparian habitat is water of impaired quality, such as reclaimed municipal wastewater, agricultural or stormwater drainage, or nitrate-contaminated groundwater.  Constructed wetlands can serve as a low-cost, relatively low maintenance, environmental friendly and habitat-enhancing water treatment alternative nationwide.  However, critical issues must be addressed prior to the widespread use of this technology.  These include ensuring the preservation of critical aquatic species by emphasizing healthy habitats, while developing reliable techniques for removing contaminants from the ecosystem. Using adaptive management to develop the best treatment design approaches possible for cleaning water of impaired quality, will ultimately produce long-term sustainability techniques for the systems.  Our hypothesis is that a \"habitat-driven\" approach to the design of constructed wetlands can and will provide all of the important aquatic ecological benefits over the long term.  These client oriented investigations will attempt to further advance constructed/engineered wetlands technology throughout the arid West with potential to apply the technology to other areas of the U.S. and globally.Long term studies of the functioning, operation, and maintenance of constructed wetlands for water treatment and wildlife enhancement in the western U.S. are rare and there is a growing need for information on how to deal with such issues as contaminant bioaccumulation (including endocrine disrupting compounds), aquatic and riparian vegetation management, vector control, sediment accumulation, internal nutrient loading, and system sustainability.  These applications focus on the analysis and monitoring of mature, operational systems, and applying techniques developed to answer these O&M issues.  Effective management and operation of treatment constructed wetlands requires a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating expertise from such varied fields as aquatic botany, engineering, hydraulics, entomology, wildlife biology, biochemistry and microbiology, along with the traditional skills of the wastewater treatment plant operator.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Objective 1: Research will focus on strategies to mitigate effects of contaminants on ecosystem processes, specific aquatic vegetation species and their biology, physiology, and health issues as they relate to effective, healthy ecosystems. Water quality influent, hydraulics, wetland configuration, plant species health and adaptability, and the biogeochemical structure of the system will be monitored using a variety of accepted techniques and will be evaluated for their functional relationships in improving habitat diversity and water quality.  Details of methodology will depend upon the site, the goals of each project, the target plant or wildlife species to encourage, and other issues of concern (i.e., contaminant issues, non-desirable plant and animal management, water depth/flow/retention time constraint issues, etc.).Objective 2: Monitor sites according to the potential hazards (i.e., collect and analyze samples to evaluate water quality, plant and sediment accumulation of hazardous elements, and/or physical hazards) that could impact aquatic plant or wildlife species of concern or the sustainability of the system.  The Principal Investigator will evaluate the extent of the hazards, as related to the target species or goals of each project, and investigate methods for improving the existing physical, biological, or chemical environment.  By pinpointing the cause of the hazard, cost-effective designs for improvements will be initiated and/or presented as options to stakeholders of the wetland systems.Objective 3: Research will be initiated to evaluate proposed restoration techniques of degraded wetland systems.  This includes studying the biology, physiology and health of the aquatic organisms within the system plus coordinating with other wetland scientists and colleagues to pinpoint causes for the degraded conditions.  Work to understand the relationships between and among the aquatic plants, hydrology, hydraulics, water quality characteristics, and wildlife at each specific wetland would be undertaken. Evaluation of the results collected would therefore determine the adjustments to be made to improve the degraded systems to achieve the desired goals of the area.  This could include a variety of strategies that could include, but are not limited to, making changes to the hydraulics, influent loading, plant species, wetland configuration, pest (plant, animal, insect or other) management, and etc.  Adaptive management strategies will be suggested to stakeholders of existing degraded systems as new information is gathered, analyzed and conclusions drawn. Additional monitoring and evaluations will be continued for as long the problem exists, provided funding is available.Objective 4: Various agencies, municipalities, and Native American communities request technical advice regarding various aspects of engineered wetlands.  The Principal Investigator will provide technical advice based on scientific findings from sites throughout the SW United States, to DOI client bureaus, other government agencies, and NGOs, as needed.  This expertise can include, but is not limited to, designing wetland systems for habitat enhancement and/or water quality improvement; providing advice on proper wetland operation and maintenance; providing plant species advice for planting, maintaining healthy wetland communities, and providing desirable, sustainable plant species for targeted wildlife; providing water quality or plant sustainability monitoring plans; and preparing adaptive management plans.  Previous and new constructed wetland research by the Principal Investigator will continue to be initiated by the needs and requests of client agencies.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Work done by FORT scientists under this task has greatly contributed to the body of knowledge in designing, building, operating, and evaluating treatment wetlands.  We were the first to prove that an overabundance of plant biomass within an ammonia-dominated treatment wetland undermines its treatment performance and it actually adds to the nutrient loading of the system (\"internal loading\").  We have also designed, tested, and determined that variation in bottom topography (as in creating shallow vegetated hummocks) can greatly contribute to improved water hydraulics, leading to improved treatment, and improved vegetation management and wildlife habitat, concurrently.  Additionally, we have demonstrated that correct water level management can greatly contribute to the sustainability of the natural wetland system efficiently and economically.  Our current focus is in determining how best to design and manage a wetland system to remove endocrine disrupting compounds from municipal wastewater prior to discharging the water into natural systems (specifically addressing TX Water Quality Board's concerns) and to effectively remove high levels of nitrates from contaminated water using a wetland system (specifically addressing AZ Water Quality Board's concerns).  Our new, innovative design will be field tested at the demonstration scale near Waco, Texas, and evaluated.  Adaptive management techniques will subsequently be employed to improve the system for higher efficacy, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. As an added benefit, using natural systems for removing emerging contaminants will minimize the potential carbon footprint of a conventional, energy-dependent treatment system.  Additionally, if constructed treatment wetlands are designed, built, and operated correctly, they could be used to sequester carbon (C) that contributes to global climate change. Research is required to determine the amounts of C and the length of time that constructed wetlands are able to sequester C.  Further research is then required to develop methods to sequester more C for longer periods of time, thus making the natural systems more sustainable.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments Due to the length of time it takes to design a constructed wetland according to the water quality to be improved and the site available; have it approved by all the stakeholders; find the funding to build it; construct it; and then achieve steady-state conditions before monitoring can occur, I have no new peer-reviewed journal articles published lately, but have had our most notable findings published previously that our current work is designed from.  According to ResearchGate, hundreds of fellow scientists have cited and/or downloaded my publications recently.  I have also presented our findings at wetland conferences, so the information is available to scientists and engineers that work and study in this field.  As a relatively new science, many misconceptions were published early on as to how the treatment systems work and how best to design them using a cookbook approach.  We have learned through our research that since wetlands are natural systems, all biota, as well as the physical parameters (i.e., sediments, water, dissolved oxygen, etc.) within the system contribute to the health and functionality which ultimately drives the success or failure of the system.  We have attempted to disseminate the knowledge that wetlands are not \"black box\" environments (which assumes that only the flow rate and detention time determines the treatment efficiency), but are complex and need to be designed and managed appropriately to optimize every function.  As new threats to the environment evolve, we are poised to determine how best to mitigate each threat using properly engineered natural systems.To test our conceptual design in removing or mitigating endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) from municipal wastewater, we selected Waco, Texas as the location to build our wetland design after examining four other potential sites.  A comprehensive monitoring plan, and a planting plan for the proposed demonstration treatment wetland has been developed and peer-reviewed.  Our innovative constructed wetlands design is currently being constructed on WMARSS property and subsequently will be monitored and evaluated to determine its ability to remove endocrine disrupting compounds from the City of Waco's wastewater.   We are working with the Bureau of Reclamation's Technical Service Center (TSC) and their Oklahoma-Texas Area Office (O-TAO)along with the Waco Metropolitan Area Regional Sewerage System (WMARSS), Baylor University, and the USGS Texas Water Science Center in the planning and subsequent sampling activities for the next three years.  Following the 3-year sampling period, the design will either be adaptively managed for further improvements or it's success will be shared with others with the hope that EDCs will be successfully bio-degraded using natural processes to preserve downstream habitats in an environmentally friendly and cost-effective manner as possible.  Additionally, we have written a comprehensive monitoring plan and the baseline monitoring results for the Oxnard Saline Treatment Wetland project in Oxnard, California. We are working with Reclamation's Southern California Area Office (SCAO),the TSC, and the City of Oxnard.Ms. Daniels gives advice and technical assistance on wetlands, wetland plants, wetland design, wetland sampling, and managing wetland treatment systems to clients, colleagues, and sister agencies as requested.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Great Plains Landscape Conservation Cooperative (GPLCC)\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Global Climate Change has become a very real threat for the survival of all wildlife species but particularly to the ones that depend upon playas, wetlands, prairie potholes or other water body types for part of their lifecycle.  As the climate gets warmer it has been documented that the Great Plains will become warmer and drier thus affecting the quantity and quality of the water available to the wildlife using those areas.  The National Drought Mitigation Center has recently released information outlying the areas that are currently experiencing drought conditions (http://drought.unl.edu/dm).  The Great Plains LCC is an area that is experiencing abnormally dry to exceptional drought throughout the region.  Drought conditions directly affect playas and seasonal wetlands since they are fed entirely by precipitation and runoff.  As drought conditions worsen, fire events tend to occur more often which can burn vegetation in and around dry wetlands and playas compromising water quality as well as the food, water, and cover that wetland species rely on.  Infiltration response of water into the aquifer is unknown under this scenario, so data are required to understand risks and formulate models to make predictions.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The study area will be within the Southern High Plains of Great Plains LCC.  Three playas will be selected from the 30 playas that federal, state, and local entities have outfitted with advanced weather stations and soil probes to measure local conditions.  Suction lysimeters will be installed at three different depths (15-, 91-, and 244-cm) within the lowest part of each of the three playas.  , Sediment samples from the auger holes will be collected as the lysimeters are installed, and the samples will be analyzed in the laboratory for soil type and particle-size distribution.  Additionally, stormwater samplers will be installed at one or more locations along drainages discharging to each playa.Water sample collection will begin as soon as practical when water is present.  Because 2011 is predicted to be a dry year, the sediments could be dry by the time this project begins, but the suction lysimeters and stormwater samplers will be put in place and ready for precipitation events when they occur.  Sample collection will then occur every week during the wet season and as often as monthly during the dry season, provided water is available.   During each sampling trip, Secchi disk measurements will be taken at each sample site when surface water is present and water will be collected for chlorophyll analyses and from the stormwater samplers.  In-situ measurements will be taken at each sample station for dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, temperature, specific conductance, and oxidation/reduction potential (ORP).  Water samples will be collected from the suction lysimeters drawn from the three soil depths, and a final water sample will be collected using a Van Dorn sampler (when necessary) from water 2-3-cm above the sediment surface for nutrient and metal analyses.  Samples will be analyzed by the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Laboratory or a suitable laboratory approved by the U.S. Geological Survey. Water samples will be analyzed for ammonia as nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrite as nitrogen (NO2-N), nitrate as nitrogen (NO3-N), organic nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), and orthophosphate as phosphorus. Samples also will be analyzed for magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), selenium (Se), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As)  or other elements of concern for wildlife.  Organics and pesticides will be analyzed depending upon funding and the life history of the playas and their watersheds.Plant communities at each of the playas will be evaluated.  Species will be identified and percent coverage estimates will be made at the beginning of the project (i.e., July 2011), during the first fall (i.e., September 2011), and at the end of the project (i.e., July 2012).  The exact dates will depend upon when funding is approved, landowner permissions are given for site access, and suitable conditions occur.  Plant samples will be collected for nutrient uptake.Sediment samples will be collected at the sample sites using an Ekman Dredge, if the water is too deep to collect with gloved hands, at the beginning of the monitoring and at the end.  The sediments will be taken to the laboratory and analyzed for total nitrogen, TP, Se, Hg, and As (or as decided).Once baseline samples are taken and the lab results available, determinations will be made as to whether further studies are warranted due to elevated constituents of concern. If nitrates are found in the playas at concentrations harmful to the wildlife or groundwater quality, a labile carbon study will be initiated to investigate mitigation techniques.  Methods of application, carbon source, and amounts applied will need to be determined by the site characteristics, level of concentration, and time of year.  Costs for this testing are not included in this proposal.Data will be collated, evaluated, and analyzed using standard statistical tests to determine, 1) differences between playas, 2) differences related to hydroperiods, and 3) differences between lysimeter depths.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The first objective is to obtain baseline water quality data from three playas in the GPLCC region to document current water quality conditions related to their hydroperiods.  The quality of the water also will be characterized as it moves down into the unsaturated soil layers beneath the playa to the depth of about 2.4 m. The second objective is to develop the best procedures to effectively identify and measure the fate of water-quality parameters of interest.The third objective is to determine whether elevated nutrients, or other elements of concern, emerge during various times of the hydroperiod and if so, identify steps to be taken to mitigate such occurrences.  Further research beyond this proposal would need to be initiated to develop treatment alternatives for effective reduction or mitigation.\n",

      "\t\tAccomplishments In FY 2017, in collaboration with other USGS Offices and NASA-Ames, sUAS flights were conducted by USGS FORT sUAS pilots near Rangeley and Crested Butte Colorado, on Palmyra Atoll,  near Louisiana Missouri, and at Colorado State University. FORT sUAS staff also assisted the DOI-OAS, UAS Division with three sUAS operator training courses.In FY 2016 sUAS flights were conducted and thermal infrared imagery was collected over roosting Sandhill cranes at Monte Vista National Wildlife Refuge. The Falcon fixed-wing sUAS was the airframe used to carry the FLIR tau-2 640 thermal infrared sensor during our night-time flights. Additionally, manned fixed-wing flights were conducted during the same night which collected thermal infrared imagery over the same roosts. Image processing and data analysis is being completed which will result in a final report comparing the two image types and resulting datasets. The analysis will include image comparison between: A) ground-based observations to sUAS-collected imagery (completed in FY 2011) and B) fixed-wing collected imagery to sUAS-collected imagery (in FY 2016).In FY 2013, tests were conducted with the Raven RQ-11A small Unmanned Aircraft System (Raven sUAS) for its suitability to detect and monitor greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) breeding sites (leks).

Approximately four and a half hours of flights were conducted over four roost sites on the Refuge, with a total of 14,658 cranes counted.In FY 2012, work was also conducted in collaboration with the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (DOA-APHIS).  APHIS staff from the National Wildlife Research Center were interested in testing the Raven sUAS sensor capabilities to detect febrile sheep.  This non-invasive way to potentially sense elevated body temperature in animals could prove important for the detection of diseases in both domestic and wild animal populations.  Preliminary test were conducted utilizing a local sheep ranch, a bucket truck, and four thermal infrared sensors. Results determined that the resolution of current sensor technology in the Raven sUAS is too coarse to detect either heat packs attached on seep legs, or the shaved symbols on their sides.In FY 2011, the first FAA-approved small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) flights in the National Airspace (NAS) were conducted using the Raven RQ-11A sUAS at Monte Vista National Wildlife Refuge.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Wetland Flora, Fauna, and Water Quality Assessment at Topock Marsh\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Historically, the habitats within what is now the Havasu National Wildlife Refuge (Havasu NWR) were created and maintained by the dynamics of the unpredictable Colorado River.  However, throughout the 20th century, the river has been regulated through a series of dams and levees, which has changed the dynamics to a late successional environment less susceptible to the unpredictable floods and droughts that characterized the unregulated river.  Under this environment, many fish and wildlife species adapted to the unregulated conditions became threatened, endangered, or of special concern to Federal and State resource management agencies [Department of the Interior (DOI), 2009].     Under an Executive Order, President Franklin Roosevelt established the Havasu NWR in 1941 as a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife.  Over the years, various canals, dikes, and ditches were constructed to help maintain the marshs original productivity (Shoreline, 2006).  However, in addition to the water management infrastructure aging over the years, the physical characteristics and overall management of the Colorado River have changed due to flooding, additional water withdrawals, flood control, and hydro power-generation.  Add to the mix that the Havasu NWR has frequently reached or exceeded its annual entitlement for diversion of water from the Colorado River, so subsequently the FWS requested an Infrastructure Improvement Project (IIP) to help protect the habitat and species that use the Refuge (DOI, 2009).  During construction of the new Firebreak Canal as part of the IIP, water levels dropped considerably lower than normal, so FWS requested USGS FORT scientists to determine how the flora and fauna within the marsh responded to those low flow conditions as well as how they fared once water levels returned to normal.  The data collected under this initial agreement was then to be used as background data for managing water in Topock Marsh in the future.     In 2013, FWS again approached USGS FORT and requested additional sampling of the marsh and a decision support tool they could use, based on the previously and currently collected data, to determine the best way to manage the water levels to optimize endangered wildlife species habitat.  FORT scientists prepared and submitted a proposal to address FWS needs and create a tool to enable FWS managers to compare water operations scenarios themselves and examine the likely changes that would occur for a given habitat of concern. A Decision Support System (DSS) is to be developed, if fully funded, for use by Havasu NWR to compare habitat availability associated with hydrologic scenarios. This forecasting approach will help FWS use the best available science to determine more effective water management strategies and it will assist with developing the mandated Havasu National Wildlife Refuge's Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP).\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Assessment of Aquatic Flora, Fauna, and Water Quality:  Surveying/sampling plans performed in 2011-2012 to assess the status of the flora, aquatic fauna, and water quality of Topock Marsh and compare to previous data were continued through 2013. FWS Desert LCC Project:Tier 1 (Aquatic Biota and Water Quality Assessments). Methods for Tier 1 follow those used earlier in Topock Marsh by FORT (Daniels and Haegele 2013). Most sampling will occur on 3 visits in 2014 (February, April, and October). We will use the same 4 sampling stations that are distributed throughout the Marsh and used previously. Methods are the same used in 2011-2012, however we will also measure turbidity and depth at each transect point. Invertebrates will be sampled from SAV patches near stations using methods described by Nelson et al. (2000). Invertebrates will usually be identified to genus and enumerated by order and biomass per sample by Rich Durfee (Certified Taxonomist). We will collect aquatic plants, sediments and water to analyze elements of concern. Zooplankton will be sampled with a vertical tow of a plankton net, and phytoplankton will be sampled from the entire water column. All plankton will be identified and enumerated (both density and biomass) by BSA Environmental Services. Fish surveys will be coordinated with FWS in October 2013. We will follow fish handling guidelines (fisheries.org/docs/policy_ useoffishes.pdf) and protocols for rare species (Mitch Thorson, FWS, pers. comm.). Growth rates of tagged native fish and weights and catch per unit effort of all species will be calculated. Water quality will be evaluated by in situ readings of physicochemistry and samples collected for analysis. Hydrolabs will obtain instantaneous as well as overnight hourly diurnal measurements. Nutrients and other parameters will be analyzed by USGS National Water Quality Laboratory according to published methods (nwql.usgs.gov). Data from Tier 1 will be compared with available historical data.Tier 2 (Emergent vegetation (EV) assessment). The sUAS will be used in autumn, when aquatic vegetation is near maximum and high winds less frequent. The sUAS will obtain high-resolution, ortho-rectified color images of EV within the entire marsh. Subsequent ground-truthing will ensure species determinations are accurate. The sUAS collects real-time geo-referenced video or still imagery during each flight which is mosaicked to produce a high-resolution image of the entire marsh area. A vegetation classification will be conducted on the imagery to quantify coverage by each vegetation type. Tier 3 (Hydrologic model development). FORT will assemble or collect bathymetry, historical marsh elevations, associated Colorado River hydrologic conditions, and other data needed to develop hydrologic models and habitat indices of interest for the Marsh. We will collect information from FWS and Reclamation to obtain data on average, wet, and dry hydrologic periods. Tier 4 (Decision Support System (DSS) development). FORT will utilize the bathymetric and other data obtained in Tiers 1-3 to develop a hind casting model to create a DSS tool. The DSS will provide spatial habitat analysis at different water elevations within Topock Marsh, so that Havasu NWR can evaluate various hydrologic scenarios and examine the likely relative changes that would occur for a given habitat of concern. This approach will help the FWS use the best available science to determine more effective water management strategies and assist with developing their CCP.      Additional proposals will be submitted to acquire funding to complete the DSS package to enable FWS managers to compare water operations scenarios and examine the likely changes that would occur for a given habitat of concern. This approach will help use the best available science to determine more effective water management strategies and assist with developing FWS's Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP).\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The resources associated with riparian zones are sensitive to changes in streamflow and sediment regimes.  Conserving and managing these resources require evaluating alternative streamflows.  This type of evaluation is most effective when it is based on quantitative relations.  Quantitative relations between streamflow and riparian vegetation are thus important to a number of management issues, including quantification of Federal Reserved water rights for National Parks and operation of Federal water management facilities.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The case study approach is inherently opportunistic, using research resources to leverage and supplement opportunities arising from specific management questions.  Several types of relations between streamflow and riparian vegetation are being developed and refined at sites managed by the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management:(1) A direct gradient model expresses the lateral zonation of vegetation as a function of hydroperiod using hydraulic models and flow duration curves.  This model is being validated by resampling and being refomulated to evaluate families of possible flow sequences.  (2) Mortality relations are used both to project the future of individual species and to predict the streamward extent of vegetation or encroachment.  We have developed mortality functions for box elder using extended inundation and shear stress at the Black Canyon of the Gunnison.  This model is being validated by resampling and being refomulated to evaluate families of possible flow sequences.  4.  Relations between herbivory, hydrology. and willow growth and establishment are being used to guide and adaptively modify restoration activites on National Wildlife Refuges, principally along the Illinois River, CO -- with cooperative funding from FWS and cyclical funds described under National Programs.5.  Relations between lateral channel migration and cottonwood stand replacement at Theodore Roosevelt National Park are being evaluated using flow-dependent exponential floodplain turnover models.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The sparse and discontinuous stands of plains cottonwood in the reach of the Missouri River flowing through the Missouri Breaks National Monument are highly valued for wildlife habitat and human recreation.  Historical accounts, including Lewis and Clark journals, suggest that cottonwood stands in this reach were also spatially restricted prior to European settlement.  A retrospective analysis linking historical peak flows to establishment years of excavated cottonwoods concluded that only infrequent, large flows could create the physical site conditions required for seedling establishment at channel elevations that were high enough to allow for successful tree recruitment.  Our long-term (12 years)seedling monitoring observations tests those hypothesis about flow dependence and extends consideration to additional controlling factors (i.e., grazing).\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Monitoring is focused on three permanent transects at each of four livestock grazing exclosures and four paired grazed sites.  At 1-m intervals along each belt transect we annually record (1) cottonwood and willow stems in four age-size classes; (2) ground surface elevation to nearest cm; (3) total vegetative cover; and (4) dominant herbaceous species.  All plots are registered to a common gradient of inundating discharge based on the site-specific empirical rating curves and discharge at a single upstream gage (Virgelle gage at Coal Banks Landing).  A system of tag lines and PVC sampling frames, total station surveying equipment, and volunteers allows us to precisely and quickly locate and sample a large number of permanent plots.  The emerging, multi-year data set is supporting several different analyses including repeated measures analysis of variance using densities at individual plots over time and a demographic model with flow- and size-dependent demographic rates.  Altering sampling procedures so that they are inexpensive enough to be sustained for additional decades will be explored and tested  in 2006-2008.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: Ecosystems -  1. Quantify and understand factors influencing patterns of temporal and spatial variability in key ecosystem components.The objective of this long-term study is to resolve the importance of interacting factors controlling the recruitment of woody riparian species by direct observation of seedling establishment and mortality.  We are trying to measure establishment and mortality rates long enough to see seedlings become saplings and trees, and thus document what combination of conditions allow survival for the generally less than 1 in 1,000,000 seedlings that do become trees.The role of factors controlling seedling establishment and mortality of seedlings and saplings is commonly inferred by considering what must have happened historically to produce the current trees; or by extrapolating from short-term experiments on seedlings.  There are very few studies that verify this indirect evidence by detailed observation of the fate of individuals over long time scales.  The naturally constrained, Wild and Scenic reach of the Missouri River in the Missouri Breaks National Monument is an especially powerful location to conduct such a study because the strength of physical and biological limits on cottonwood recruitment means that conditions leading to successful recruitment stand out as relatively unique and identifiable.Thus, the general scientific importance of the proposed work stems from (1) producing a rare data set allowing direct examination of how seedling and sapling establishment and mortality factors determine stand recruitment rates and patterns; and (2) comparison of cottonwood recruitment along the geomorphically distinctive Wild and Scenic reach with other well-studied rivers where processes of meandering and channel narrowing are more dominant.  The study also addresses important site-specific management needs at a location of high regional and national value.  These local management issues include (1) Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license conditions for upstream PPL-MT hydroelectric facilities; (2) operation of upstream Bureau of Reclamation storage reservoirs; and (3) Bureau of Land Management grazing management, river recreation, Federal Reserved water rights, and National Monument planning.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Effects of Ecological Drought on Riparian Vegetation\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In the arid and semi-arid interior of western North America, riparian cottonwood (Populus spp.), willow (Salix spp.), and other native species are being replaced by invasive non-native shrubs and trees.  The most abundant invasive, tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima and T. chinensis), now covers about 470,000 - 650,000 ha and has become the dominant riparian woody species in the Southwestern United States.  Other important invasive species include Russian-olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) and Siberian-elm (Ulmus pumila). These great changes in riparian woody species composition have been associated with loss of plant diversity, degradation of habitat for vertebrate animals, decreased channel conveyance, increased water loss from evapotranspiration, and loss of aesthetic and recreational opportunities.Ecological studies have identified environmental factors that influence the abundance of native and non-native species. For example, relative to cottonwood, tamarisk matures at a younger age; has a longer and later season of seed release; is more tolerant of high salinity, fire, and water shortage; is less tolerant of extended inundation, burial by sediment, and physical damage by floods; may be favored by finer-textured substrates; and may be less susceptible to livestock grazing.  Upstream dams may favor tamarisk over cottonwood by delaying high flows and associated formation of seedling establishment sites until after the season of cottonwood seed viability.  The availability of tamarisk seeds throughout the summer and early fall may also explain the success of this species in occupying land exposed along reservoir margins during summer drawdowns.North of about 39o north longitude tamarisk is relatively scarce, individuals are small, and dieback is frequent, indicating that frost sensitivity limits northward expansion.  On the other hand, some populations of tamarisk in the north are growing rapidly suggesting that there may be genetic variability in frost tolerance.  Gaskin and Schaal have used DNA analysis to show that much of the tamarisk in the US is a hybrid between T. chinensis and T. ramosissima that has not been found in the Eurasian lands of origin.  Phenotypic differences among T. chinensis, T. ramosissima and their hybrids may explain some of the apparent variation in frost tolerance and other characteristics across North America.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We are carrying out 2 research thrusts1. Common Garden.  In Fort Collins, Colorado, we will plant individuals of the invasive tamarisk and the native cottonwood collected from across western North America.  We will relate cold hardiness of these plants to species, time of year, climate of origin, and genetic variability. To populate the common garden we will collect 25 specimens of each species at fifteen sites from Mexico to Canada. Plants will be grown in a randomized grid.  Flowers will be removed to prevent seed set. Cold hardiness will be measured at FORT. 2. We will develop a model of factors controlling distribution of western riparian invasive species in order to predict shifts in their distribution resulting from changes in climate and land management.  The model will be based on species abundance data we have collected at 475 long-term USGS gaging stations in the western US and gridded data sets representing both present and future climate. Variables considered will include winter temperatures, actual and potential evapotranspiration, flow variability, flood timing, grazing, proximity to planted populations of invasives, and sediment particle size.\n",

Develop indexes of ecosystem sensitivity to change and vulnerability to potential stressors, and tools to predict ecosystem responses to environmental change.This Task has two goals:1.

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Throughout the world, riparian habitats have been dramatically modified from their natural condition.  Dams are one of the principal causes of these changes, via their alteration of water and sediment regimes.  Because of the array of ecological goods and services provided by natural riparian ecosystems, their conservation and restoration have become the focus of many land and water managers.  Efforts to restore riparian habitats and other riverine ecosystems have included managing flow releases downstream of dams to more closely mimic natural flows, but dam removal has received little attention as a possible approach to riparian restoration. Our work on the Elwha River is a collaborative effort primarily with other USGS scientists, scientists and graduate students from Eastern Washington University, resource specialists and scientists from Olympic National Park and the Lower Elwha Klallam tribe. Funding has all come from USGS.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will sample long term vegetation monitoring plots in three river reaches (above, between, and below the two former dams), two former reservoir areas, and the Elwha estuary. We will also survey the topography at these sites. We will sample soils from a subset of existing, permanent vegetation plots along the Elwha River.  Within each of the three river reaches (upstream, between the dams, below the dams), we will sample within several different patch types, determined by a combination of overstory vegetation type and topographic position (relative to the active channel).  Patch types will likely include:  near channel bars dominated by Salix spp.; low floodplain surfaces dominated by Alnus rubra < 30 years old; floodplain surfaces dominated by Alnus rubra > 30 yrs old; floodplain surfaces dominated by Populus trichocarpa with later successional conifers in the understory; terraces dominated by Acer macrophyllum with later successional conifers in the understory.  For the textural and chemical analyses, we will sample 5 replicates (permanent plots) within 5 vegetation patch types in each of the three study reaches (total of 75 plots).  At each plot, multiple samples will be combined and bulked for analysis.  Samples will be taken from two depths (total number of samples = 150).

      "\t\tTaskTitle Colorado River Basin Riparian Ecology\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Riparian zones are a major part of most riverine ecosystems.  Riparian zones contribute to human welfare by providing a variety of ecosystem services, including streamflow regulation; sequestration or elimination of waterborne pollutants; groundwater recharge; sediment retention; soil nutrient retention; stream bank stabilization; stream temperature moderation; augmentation of aquatic food bases; provision of food, forage, and fiber; maintenance of biodiversity; and provision of aesthetic, cultural, and recreational resources. These services result from the normal functioning of riverine ecosystems.  However, the processes responsible for producing the structure and controlling the functioning of riparian landscapes in Western desert environments, including the provision of ecosystem services, are not well understood.  In principle, the complexity of the landscape results from interactions among organisms using the adjacent terrestrial, riparian, and aquatic areas, as well as interactions between organisms and climate, soils, river hydrology, groundwater dynamics, and fluvial geomorphology. Most relevant riparian literature deals with systems in mesic environments or that lack the characteristic hydrograph and sediment loads of rivers like the Colorado, with headwaters in snow-rich, high mountain regions and middle and lower reaches in sparsely vegetated desert environments. Further, rivers in the semiarid and arid West are often segmented into ecologically distinct alluvial and canyon reaches, and the surrounding uplands range from cold to hot desert. There are no detailed descriptions of the structure of these riparian systems prior to their modification by white settlers for farming, livestock grazing, wood and timber harvest, gravel mining, or other activities.  Few ecological studies were conducted prior to construction of dams and diversion structures along the rivers.  It was primarily after regulated flow became the predominant condition and undesirable effects on populations and habitats became apparent that ecological research on these rivers began. Key questions such as \"To what extent have ecosystem services in the Colorado River Basin been degraded?\" cannot be answered without a better understanding of riparian structure and functional relationships. Descriptions of taxonomic assemblages within riparian corridors of most aridland rivers--a prerequisite for understanding community structure--are often incomplete or speculative, and basic natural history information is in some cases lacking.  Very few studies have examined nutrient dynamics, riparian plant-animal interactions, or floodplain soil processes, and assertions regarding linkages between riverine aquatic, riparian, and upland ecosystems are largely speculative. Filling these knowledge gaps will help clarify and quantify the changes in ecosystem services resulting from water resources development, climate change, and other factors.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Specific research objectives are met through an interdisciplinary team approach using: 1) geomorphological and topographic information; 2) dendrochronology of riparian trees; 3) manipulative experiments and monitoring programs that examine responses of plants to hydrologic, geomorphic, and other environmental factors, 4) manipulative experiments and monitoring programs that examine effects of these same factors on breakdown rates of plant litter, 5) an array of plant ecological field sampling techniques, 6) an array of animal sampling techniques; 7) assessment of effects of herbivory using exclosure-based field experiments; and 8) landscape mapping and simulation modeling of riparian landscape dynamics.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: Ecosystems - 1. Quantify and understand factors influencing patterns of temporal and spatial variability in key ecosystem components.The overall research objective is to describe the effects of river regulation on key riparian species and processes and elucidate the mechanisms responsible for those effects.  The work will increase the general understanding of how regulated flows modify species distribution and abundance, community interactions, and floodplain ecosystem functioning while also providing species- and site-specific information of immediate benefit to water resource managers and floodplain land managers in the Colorado River Basin.  The work builds upon and extends research comparing riparian structure and functioning at matched sites on the regulated Green River below Flaming Gorge Dam and the unregulated Yampa River in the vicinity of Dinosaur National Monument, and at sites along the extremely regulated lower Colorado River. Much of the work centers on the population biology of Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii). Along many mid- to low-elevation segments of rivers in the Colorado River Basin, this is the only large tree present. Focal animal species include vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores potentially important as controllers of ecosystem processes. A key process linking riparian and aquatic environments involves the entry of large woody debris--entire cottonwood trees--into the river due to channel migration. A key riparian process linking plant and animal communities, as well as riparian and aquatic environments, is nutrient cycling. Thus, the research program has three interrelated sub-objectives: (1) elucidate the effects of regulation on focal species ecology, e.g., cottonwood stand structure and demographics and leaf beetle population dynamics, (2) elucidate the effects of regulation on floodplain nitrogen pools and fluxes, and their influence on cottonwood health, (3) elucidate effects of regulation on plant successional processes and long-term landscape dynamics.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Because cottonwoods are the dominant native riparian tree species in the semiarid and arid portions of the interior western United States, the forests and woodlands they make up are very likely necessary for maintaining the full suite and normal levels of ecosystem services provided by the stream and river ecosystems in this region.  Task research has produced the following findings:1. About 50% of the alluvial floodplain area below 1800 m along major streams and rivers in the Upper Colorado River Basin was classified as Fremont cottonwood forest, but most of these forests and woodlands have a sparse canopy and are probably not self-sustaining.  About 36% of the floodplain area is no longer natural vegetation (i.e., it has been developed in some way).  Fremont cottonwood forest has increased in extent along some rivers in the Upper Colorado River Basin, but is declining in the Basin as a whole.2. The levels of flow regulation (hydrologic alteration) and floodplain development are unrelated on rivers in the Upper Colorado River Basin.3. Both river regulation (by altering the natural flow regime) and floodplain development can negatively impact Fremont cottonwood forest regeneration and thereby reduce the viability of forests and woodlands.  Floodplain forest conservation in semiarid and arid regions is not simply a matter of providing appropriate stream flows.4. Large woody debris input to streams has been greatly reduced or eliminated on river reaches where flow alteration has eliminated overbank flooding and reduced channel meandering as well as where development has eliminated floodplain trees.  Allochthonous input of matter and energy to streams from tree leaf litter is reduced by declines in floodplain forest extent as well as canopy density.5. Long-term decomposition processes examined at a single site featuring largely unaltered hydrology suggests that most nitrogen, and presumably other nutrients, would be released from tree leaf litter outside the flood season, when retention within the floodplain would be likely.  Macroinvertebrate detritivores appear to have only a minor role in leaf breakdown, with weather and river flow regime (flooding) having primary control over decomposition rate. 6. With the exception perhaps of its contribution to bird biodiversity, the contribution of alluvial flood plain vegetation structure and ecological functioning, including forest and woodland dynamics, to ecosystem services in semiarid and arid regions is largely theoretical and unquantified.  There is an urgent need to document these services using the few remaining rivers and reaches with only modest alteration of hydrology and largely intact natural vegetation.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Although of limited spatial extent, riparian ecosystems of the Colorado Plateau are critical landscape elements with uniquely high levels of biological diversity.  These systems are structured and maintained by physical and biological processes across a range of scales.  The most significant anthropogenic stressors to steams of this region include activities that disrupt natural flows of water and sediment, including damming or diversion of stream flow or construction of channel stabilization structures.  Most of the larger perennial streams of the Colorado Plateau are subject to these stressors, which alter channel and flood plain forming processes and typically result in the loss or ecological simplification of native riparian communities.  Such changes also contribute to the establishment and spread of non-native species like Tamarisk, which alter ecosystem properties, increasing, for example, the frequency and intensity of fires, to the detriment of native species.  Natural disturbance processes such as fire, and human land-use activities including livestock grazing, timber  harvesting, agricultural clearing and groundwater pumping alter watershed conditions and thus indirectly influence downstream riparian ecosystems.  Localized impacts like the creation of trails within riparian corridors further degrade site-specific riparian conditions and contribute to the possibility of arroyo cutting or channel incision, which can produce long-term changes in the structure and functioning of riparian ecosystems by radically altering patterns of sediment erosion and deposition and by lowering alluvial water tables.  The Park Service desires to develop a monitoring protocol that will provide park managers with a baseline against which to gauge the long-term status and trends of riparian resources relative to natural processes and anthropogenic stressors, as well as a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of management interventions aimed at protecting or restoring riparian ecosystems.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Monitoring physical variables--In each monitored stream reach, we will: i) survey and construct a plan-view map of the reach, ii) permanently locate and resurvey channel cross-sections by placing surveyed head-pins, across the stream, on either side of the bottomland; iii) determine channel bed material composition; and iv) determine particle size composition of alluvial surfaces.  We will also measure stream stage, and in conjunction with existing nearby USGS stream gages, will establish site-specific stage discharge relations.  Where possible, we will use existing alluvial well information, or establish new alluvial wells, to develop functional relationships between surface water and alluvial groundwater dynamics.  From this, hydrologic gradients, based on depth to groundwater or duration of surface water inundation can be developed for geomorphic surfaces or specific groups of plants (e.g., Auble et al. 1994, and In press) and used to develop a process oriented understanding of vegetation response to streamflow dynamics and channel change.This sampling design will be replicated within similar geomorphic settings, for example, fan-eddy complexes in bedrock canyons or flood plain meanders in unconfined alluvial reaches.  These geomorphic features will thus serve as a sampling template for measurements of related biotic response variables.  Monitoring riparian vegetation variables--At each sample location we will measure vegetation in plots and belt transects co-located with the channel cross-sections described above.  A tag line will be stretched between the head-pins on each cross-section and 1 by 2 m plots will be used to sample herbs (cover and richness by species), by randomly locating and surveying in plots on all identifiable alluvial surfaces from waters edge to the upland boundary (following G. Auble and M. Scott, unpublished data).  Similarly, tag lines will be used to quantify the percent cover of all woody riparian species by recording linear distance over which individual crowns intersect the line.  Patches of woody vegetation intersected by the line will also be measured for vertical structural diversity using a pole-intercept method (following Lite and Stromberg, In press).   In this way, vegetation structure and composition can be precisely re-sampled over time and vegetation metrics can be directly and quantitatively linked to key physical variables.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem This task is a continuation of PA00DAV.4, \"Tamarisk Removal and Erosion\". Managers of riparian lands across the West are increasingly seeking to remove stands of the invasive shrub, tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), for purposes such as reducing water lost to evapotranspiration, improving wildlife habitat, or restoring native vegetation.  However, removing what is now the dominant riparian tree in the Southwest could have unintended consequences, including accelerated erosion.  Stabilizing sediment was a primary rationale for the original introduction of tamarisk.  Many of the streams currently targeted for tamarisk control could become geomorphically unstable if the woody vegetation were removed, and subsequent floods could cause substantial sediment erosion and transport, potentially increasing flood hazards for communities downstream and accelerating the filling of reservoirs with sediment. Recent rapid spread of the intentionally introduced tamarisk leaf beetle is leading to widespread defoliation of tamarisk. Where beetles kill tamarisk the likelihood of flood erosion is increased. Despite these risks, the effect of tamarisk control on erosion has received little attention.  Much of the tamarisk is on Tribal Lands, whose managers must balance the need for water and traditional wildlife habitat with concerns about erosion and herbicide application.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Along the Rio Puerco New Mexico, we are documenting the history of channel change using repeat cross sections, longitudinal profiles, and LiDAR topography, combined with trench stratigraphy dated by tamarisk dendrochronology.

We need to collect LiDAR topography in streams susceptible to extreme arroyo erosion in the Middle Rio Grande watershed. We also need to collect data on the extent of tamarisk defoliation and mortality caused by the tamarisk leaf beetle. This will allow us to determine the extent of tamarisk mortality and erosion related to spread of the beetle.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Long-term, sustainable control of invasive plant species is largely dependent on successful revegetation of a site following removal/control of the invasive.  Despite this, revegetation receives relatively little attention in the context of control.  Current information has not been well-synthesized, and often site-specific studies have not been conducted with methodologies that enable rigorous interpretation of results.  In many cases, researchers have hypothesized that streamflow regulation can favor tamarisk and disfavor native riparian vegetation.  Thus, some efforts have been initiated to manage streamflow in ways that favor native taxa, but these efforts have generally not been monitored for to evaluate their efficacy.Beginning in the early 20th century, non-native shrub species, including tamarisk (also commonly known as saltcedar; for example, Tamarix ramosissima, Tamarix chinensis), Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), and Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila) were introduced to the United States for use as ornamental plants and erosion-control. By 1915, some naturalized populations had become established, and, by the 1960s, tamarisk was present along virtually all rivers in the semi-arid and arid parts of the west and was quite abundant along lower reaches of the major southwestern rivers, including the Colorado, Rio Grande, Gila, and Pecos. Russian-olive has expanded more slowly and is generally distributed in more northern locales than tamarisk, but is now the fourth most common woody riparian plant in the 17 western states of the US (Friedman et al., 2005). The major period of tamarisk invasion coincided with changing physical conditions along western rivers associated with the construction and operation of dams. In many cases, these altered physical conditions appear to have been more favorable for tamarisk than native riparian competitors, such as cottonwoods and willows.To date, Siberian elm has received much less attention than tamarisk and Russian olive as an invasive plant in riparian ecosystems. Siberian elm is considered invasive in 41 of the United States, has been declared a noxious weed in New Mexico, and is often referenced as the third most abundant invasive woody riparian plant in western North America (Friedman et al., unpublished data, U.S.D.A., 2010, Zalapa et al., 2010). However, little is known about its ecology, especially in its invaded, North American range. Like Russian olive, Siberian elm may be spreading relatively slowly, but still have the potential to become a dominant riparian species and displace native species over time. Basic research is needed to evaluate how common Siberian elm is relative to tamarisk and Russian olive currently, what environmental conditions are associated with its invasion, and whether and where it has the potential to spread.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Test riparian revegetation methods along the Virgin River, Zion National Park\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The North Fork of the Virgin River, which flows through Zion National Park, was channelized in the early 1900s to protect the adjacent, newly built (and now historic) road and Zion Lodge. Construction of revetments (wire caging filled with rocks) stabilized and heightened the rivers banks. The effort has been successful in preventing flooding; however, channelization has had ecological repercussions. Historically, cottonwood and willow forest dominated the canyon floor, providing habitat and forage to native fauna and important aesthetic values to humans. Today, the forest is composed solely of aging trees, as natural flood processes that supported phreatophyte seedling establishment no longer occur. As a result, non-native plants are invading and dominating the understory (primarily tamarisk [Tamarix ramossisima], cheatgrass [Bromus tectorum], and ripgut brome [Bromus rigidus]).The decline of native riparian forests is a concern throughout the western United States, especially in arid environments where riparian zones support a disproportiantely high percentage of the overall regional biodiversity. Zion's General Management Plan prescribes revetment removal along a 2 mile stretch of river where the most enduring and extensive revetments occur. The goal is to restore natural connectivity between the river and its floodplain, thus reinvigorating ecological processes and native biota; however, >5,000,000 square feet of ground will be disturbed during removal and recontouring. Without active revegetation, the disturbed area will be susceptible to soil erosion and further invasion of exotic plants. Well designed experiments are needed to test revegetation methods along the Virgin River on a small scale prior to dechannelizing efforts.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Modeling the importance of native vs. invasive vegetation dominance for neotropical migratory bird use of western riparian habitats\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In the Southwestern U.S., riparian areas are extremely important habitat for breeding birds and as stopover habitat for Neotropical migrants.  One of the key challenges facing the management and conservation of the riparian-dependent birds is that riparian areas are dynamic, with individual habitat patches subject to cycles of creation, growth, and loss due to drought, flooding, fire, and other disturbances.  Furthermore, the majority of southwestern riparian areas have been extensively altered, especially by water management activities and the spread of invasive plants such as tamarisk (saltcedar) and Russian Olive.  As a result of both natural dynamism and human-related impacts, the structure and composition of riparian habitat varies greatly across the landscape.  Not surprisingly, the value of these riparian habitats as bird habitat also varies, based on species composition, vegetation density and diversity, hydrological conditions, and other factors.  Currently, there are no quantitative models for predicting the relative value of riparian habitat for breeding bird communities or migrating birds, or to readily quantify the amount of riparian habitat at large spatial scales.  Both of these capabilities are needed if managers are to be able to assess recent and current riparian habitat conditions, or understand the factors that determine bird use of riparian areas.In 1999, the Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD) developed a GIS-based model (Hatten and Paradzick 2003) that successfully identified Southwestern Willow Flycatcher breeding habitat from Landsat imagery and digital elevation models.  In doing so, the model created several probability classes of riparian habitat, based primarily on the vigor of the riparian vegetation as quantified by NDVI (Normalized Density Vegetation Index).  In 2002, Dockens et al. (2004) applied the Hatten and Paradzick model throughout Arizona, for lowland riparian areas below 1,524 m elevation and within 1.6 km of perennial or intermittent waters.  The model successfully distinguished different riparian habitat classes that were directly correlated with the probability of flycatcher occupancy.  Most recently, Hatten and Sogge (2007) applied the model to a large stretch of the middle Rio Grande, where it again successfully predicted the location of dense riparian habitats in which flycatchers bred.We propose to determine whether this model can be used to characterize vegetation/habitat for other riparian dependent birds.  Specifically, we will test whether the different probability class rankings (originally developed only for Southwestern Willow Flycatchers) are related to broader measures of riparian bird community abundance and diversity.  Also, because the original Hatten and Paradzick model did not address plant species composition, we will collect data to determine the degree to which the relative composition of exotic and native dominants affects the model performance, as measured by bird community response.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will apply the same modeling techniques (Hatten and Paradzick 2003; Dockens et al. 2004; Hatten and Sogge 2007) to identify and map probability classes of riparian habitat along the Rio Grande, from Elephant Butte Dam to just south of Albuquerque. We will: (1) create GIS variables derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and 30-m resolution DEMs, (2) populate a logistic regression model with the four GIS variables to create a probability grid, (3) divide riparian vegetation into five probability classes, (4) assess model accuracy within the probability classes with errors of omission, and model fit with nest or territory density, and (5) incorporate vegetation characteristics into the model.GIS Model - The logistic regression equation we will use to calculate the probability of nest occurrence is based the following equation: probability = exp(logit) /  1 + exp(logit); where the logit is: 1.483(NDVI) + 0.098(NDVIBEST) + 0.034(FLOODPL) + 0.648(NDVISTD)  6.074.   The four variables are defined as follows: (1) NDVI - relative density of green vegetation (12 classes) at the site (0.09 ha); (2) NDVIBEST - amount (ha) of densest vegetation (NDVI class 12) within a 4.5-ha neighborhood; (3) FLOODPL - amount (ha) of floodplain or flat terrain (<2.5 degrees) within a 41-ha neighborhood, and (4) NDVISTD - the standard deviation in NDVI within a 4.5-ha neighborhood.GIS Variables - We will create riparian-vegetation density grids (0.09-ha cells) for the project and test areas usingTM images that were obtained in 2006. Riparian-vegetation density grids will be created in a four-step process: (1) calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) within 1.6 km of perennial/intermittent waters, (2) cluster NDVI into 12 interval-scaled classes, (3) overlay NDVI classes and satellite imagery to find the best cutpoint between riparian and upland vegetation, and  (4) mask upland and non-riparian features, then divide riparian forest into 12 new interval-scaled density classes. Riparian Bird Community Data   We will conduct bird counts at approximately 100 randomly selected point-count stations, stratified such that the count stations cover the full array of probability classes.  The point-count stations will also be located so as to include various levels of invasive and native plant compositions.  Counts will be conducted once per station during the 2008 breeding season (May through July).  At each point, we will record all bird species seen or heard during a 10-minute period, and estimate the distance to each detected bird.  From this, we will generate bird community metrics for each point, including species diversity, total abundance, abundance by bird species, and species density (for the latter, where sample size and detectability are sufficient).Riparian Vegetation Data  At each point count station, we will record ocular estimates of key vegetation structure variables likely to affect bird abundance or use.  These include canopy height (bottom and top), canopy density (using a densitometer), structural class category (e.g., gallery riparian, early successional; exact categories to be developed), and percent of each dominant tree/shrub species within a 30 m radius. Model Fit and Accuracy Assessment - To assess the fit of the model we will overlay bird community data on the five probability classes. Bird density is obtained by dividing bird count numbers within each probability class by area (ha) of probability class.  We expect bird density to increase in either a linear, exponential, or binary fashion in the probability classes.  We will also incorporate the riparian vegetation data into the model, to determine the relationship between field-measured structure data and model-generated NDVI and probability class.  Furthermore, we will determine whether incorporating plant species information, particularly with regard to native versus invasive composition, improves the predictive performance of the model\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The Hatten and Paradzick model was clearly successful at predicting, based on remote sensing data (NDVI) and GIS-based themes, dense riparian sites in Arizona and New Mexico.  This is the first large-scale predictive model of its kind for Southwestern Willow Flycatcher habitat, or for any other riparian bird species.  We propose to apply the GIS-based model to identify different probability classes of riparian habitat along the Rio Grande in New Mexico, and to determine how riparian bird abundance and community composition vary within the different classes.  Furthermore, we will evaluate whether inclusion of vegetation data - particularly native versus invasive composition of dominants -  affects the model results.  Based upon the models input variables and its performances for flycatchers, we think it has strong potential to work as a predictor for the broader riparian bird community as well.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Erosional consequence of tamarisk removal [see mirror task, 8172DAV.4.1]\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Managers of riparian lands across the West are increasingly seeking to remove stands of the invasive shrub, tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), for purposes such as reducing water lost to evapotranspiration, improving wildlife habitat, or restoring native vegetation.  However, removing what is now the dominant riparian tree in the Southwest could have unintended consequences, including accelerated erosion.  Stabilizing sediment was a primary rationale for the original introduction of tamarisk.  Many of the streams currently targeted for tamarisk control could become geomorphically unstable if the woody vegetation were removed, and subsequent floods could cause substantial sediment erosion and transport, potentially increasing flood hazards for communities downstream and accelerating the filling of reservoirs with sediment. Despite these risks, the effect of tamarisk control on erosion has received little attention.  Much of the tamarisk is on Tribal Lands, whose managers must balance the need for water and traditional wildlife habitat with concerns about erosion and herbicide application.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Task 1.  We will document the changes in channel geometry resulting from tamarisk removal in 2003 along the Rio Puerco upstream of Highway 6. We hypothesize that high flows will erode sediment where tamarisk has been removed and deposit that sediment downstream. From Highway 6 downstream to the confluence with the Rio Grande we already have a detailed longitudinal profile, three dated trenches, 50 recent channel cross sections, several historic cross-sections, and LIDAR topography.  We will extend the longitudinal survey upstream of Highway 6 and establish 50 additional cross sections in and upstream of the zone of tamarisk eradication. These surveys will allow us to document channel change during the next high flow and to verify the channel erosion model discussed under Task 3. Task 2.  We will document channel change at a site, probably along the Pecos River, where tamarisk has been removed and subsequent high flows have already occurred.  The chosen site will include a stream gage, a downstream reservoir so that repeat reservoir surveys can be used to document changes in sediment delivery, and pre-existing  surveyed channel cross sections.  We will use historical aerial photographs to document changes in channel width, and we will prepare a dated trench downstream of the tamarisk removal to quantify sediment deposition on the flood plain.Task 3.  We will enhance our existing hydraulic model for the Rio Puerco to calculate the effect of tamarisk removal on flood attenuation and sediment transport. This model incorporates direct calculation of the fluid drag on riparian vegetation while calculating the stage and shear stress distribution resulting from specified flows. We will model overbank flows using detailed tamarisk stem density measurements already completed on the Rio Puerco flood plain.  This will allow us to calculate the attenuation of historic floods along the Rio Puerco that occurred before and after the proliferation of tamarisk on the flood plain.  We will use the shear stress distribution produced by the model to predict channel change in and downstream of the reach where tamarisk has been removed. We will re-install the discontinued stream gage 08352500, located along the Rio Puerco at Highway 6, to complement existing gage 08353000, located near the river mouth. Model predictions will be tested using gage data and the results of Task 1.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Our goals are to quantify changes in erosion rates resulting from past tamarisk eradication efforts and to develop a model that can predict erosion resulting from future tamarisk eradication.Task 1) Document the changes in channel geometry resulting from tamarisk removal along the Rio Puerco west of Los Lunas, New Mexico.Task 2) Document channel change at a site in the Southwest where tamarisk has been removed and subsequent high flows have already occurred.Task 3) Enhance our existing hydraulic model for the Rio Puerco to calculate the effect of tamarisk removal on flood attenuation and sediment transport.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) are conducting coordinated conservation actions along the Green and Colorado River corridors in Utah to enhance resource conditions and related societal values associated with these iconic riverine ecosystems.  Since the late 19th century, riverine ecosystems throughout much of western North America have been altered through the introduction of nonnative plant and fish species, water withdrawals, flow regulation by dams, and many other human activities.  Riparian vegetation in the project area currently is undergoing rapid change as extensive stands of nonnative tamarisk (Tamarix spp., the dominant woody plant in the river corridor) are being impacted by expanding populations of the tamarisk leaf beatle (Diorhabda elongata) which was first released in this region in 2005.  Rapid changes in tamarisk populations, associated changes in geomorphic conditions and plant community characteristics (including an influx of additional exotic plant species), and increasing uncertainty about effects of climate change and societal water demands on future flow regimes have resulted in heightened concern about how to most effectively protect or restore resource values along the river corridor.  NPS, TNC, and BLM have collectively identified a need for science-based technical support in planning, coordinating, and implementing prioritized conservation actions that will achieve maximum benefits to riverine resources and societal values with limited financial and human resources.  The U.S. Geological Survey Fort Collins Science Center (USGS FORT) has been selected to provide this technical support because of FORTs recognized scientific expertise and credibility in the ecology of riverine ecosytems.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Ecological effects of fire and fire management\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Recent efforts to re-introduce natural fire regimes into the wildland-urban interface have met with mixed success as prescribed fire can pose significant hazards to communities along park boundaries.  For example, the Cerro Grande, which began as a prescribed fire at Bandelier National Monument, ultimately burned 17,000 ha, threatened Los Alamos National Laboratory, destroyed 235 homes in Los Alamos, and burned lands owned by the San Ildefonso and Santa Clara Pueblos.  The Outlet fire was a prescribed fire that escaped the Grand Canyon National Park and burned over 5,000 ha.  Thus, parks increasing are using mechanical treatments (e.g., thinning, pruning lower branches) to reduce fuel loads prior to re-introduction of fire.  Mechanical treatments are not without controversy, however, because mechanical treatments are often not viewed by the general public as consistent with National Park Service mandates.  Yet, allowing fuel loads to continue to escalate is not a viable option because severe wildland fires may result putting adjacent communities at risk, as occurred with fires in Yellowstone National Park and Mesa Verde National Monument.  Thus, park managers face the difficult challenge of reducing fire risks while balancing the ecological issues associated with fuel reduction programs.  Because fuel reduction programs are often based primarily on risk reduction, managers currently lack the tools necessary to evaluate ecological tradeoffs.  Because of the urgency for fuels reduction, managers require tools to evaluate how fuel reduction alternatives affect species of concern, as well as the long-term health of forests.Increased recognition that a one-size-fits-all approach to fuels reduction is not appropriate across different forested types.  This is also true within forest types.  Factors such as topography (e.g., slope, elevation, aspect) and current stand structures and fuel loadings may predispose certain stands to more extreme fire behavior than others.  Likewise, not all fuel treatments will be equally effective across different fuel loadings, which can occur under different topographical contexts.  Because hazard mitigation is costly, parks need to prioritize areas for treatment.  Manager also need to compare relative risk reduction among fuel treatment options and assess the range of acceptable fire behavior.  Thus, cost-effective implementation of the Healthy Forest Initiatives requires tools to efficiently implement fuels reduction programs.  Indeed, a priority research need identified at Rocky Mountain Park, where fire risks to adjacent communites are high, is such effective fuels treatment design. Spatially explicit analyses of current fuel conditions and the impacts of various treatment options on predicted fire behavior will allow managers to choose from among different options and position treatments where they would be most beneficial at reducing fire risk.  The ability to optimize risk reduction while minimizing costs would be advantageous for Parks, adjacent property owners, and tax payers.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology 1. Conduct basic research and develop application of information on the effects of fire on the structure and function of forested systems across multiple spatial and temporal scales, linking current fire effects to historical conditions and management prescriptions. 2. Information on fuel conditions for many areas of the country is available in LANDFIRE (The Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools Project).  We propose to link LANDFIRE databases to fire behavior models to compare the effects of fuel load reduction on fire risks.  In addition, we will link the output of fire models to a vegetation dynamics model (Visual Forest Simulator) to compare the effects of various fuel treatments on long-term forest dynamics.  We will use the predicted forest conditions to evaluate habitat availability for several indicator species that represent a range of affinities with different forest structures. These models will be useful in determining cost-effective ways to achieve fire risk abatement for priority hazardous fuel conditions and allow managers to evaluate the ecological trade-offs of management alternatives.3. Develop tools for assessment and modeling of post-fire effects: Products include maps and models to assess fire effects, including burn severity maps, post-fire landscape structure and dynamics, comparisons to historic range of variation, and tools for monitoring ecological effects.4. Evaluate the effects and effectiveness of post-fire rehabilitation: Provide information to evaluate the potential ecological and economic trade-offs of post-fire management by quantifying: 1) the effectiveness of post-fire rehabilitation treatments on reducing post-fire hazards (e.g., debris flows and erosion) and, 2) the ecological effects on post-fire communities and landscapes (e.g., native and non-native vegetation, wildlife communities, sensitive species).\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Population Estimation Research\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has responsibility for managing some 178 wild horse herds and 51 wild burro herds in the western United States.  BLM responsibilities include (1) assessing habitat conditions and maintaining herds at levels that can be supported by the range, (2) gathering and removing excess animals, (3) and maintaining genetic diversity of the herds.  Reproductive rates in these herds are high; wild horse herds often grow 15-20% per year.  In order to maintain herds within the carrying capacities of the ranges, excess animals are periodically gathered and offered for adoption.  However, the supply of animals available for adoption exceeds the demand, and animals that are not adopted are maintained indefinitely in short- and long-term holding facilities at considerable expense.  BLM, USGS, and APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA) are partners in a research program designed to assist BLM in developing more effective and efficient management programs for these herds.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Methods of population estimation previously tested include mark-resight (using individual horse color patterns as the mark), and simultaneous double-count wiht sightability correction. We are also evaluating distance sampling, and various combinations of these techniques.  Data for these methods are collected using helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft. We initiated new work in 2014 on mark resight using non invasive sampling (fecal DNA), as well as developing work to test the use of simultaneous doublecount on burros.  Whenever possible, data are collected on herds where \"truth\" (the actual population size) is known (e.g., from counting the number of animals gathered or the number released back to the range after a gather), and flights are combined with routine BLM census work to minimize costs.  When the actual population size is not known, population estimates are obtained before and after a gather and removal, with the difference between the two representing an estimate of the number of animals removed.  Population estimation using noninvasive genetic sampling: We initiated new research in 2014 to determine if we can use fecal DNA to estimate population size using mark-resight models, and also ascertain herd heterozygosity in HMAs. Up to this point, blood samples are taken from individual animals during gathers on both the three intensively studied herds and other herds specified by BLM.  These samples are analyzed for genetic diversity by Dr. Gus Cothron of Texas A&M University. We are working with Gus to compare blood versus feces, to see if we can develop a non-invasive means to obtain genetic structure of populations.Fecal samples will be collected in two ways:1.In population genetics sampling sessions in May, August, and November, we will collect more than twice as many samples as the number of horses managers believe are in the HMA, to test the accuracy of the single sampling method and to identify the optimal season for sampling. Invasive species will also be assessed from these samples.2.In monthly sampling sessions between April and December, we will create a dung aging protocol and determine when it is no longer feasible to extract DNA because it is too degraded.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program Element and Goal: Wildlife, #1 - Provide the Scientific Foundation for the Conservation of Terrestrial Plants, Wildlife, and Habitats by developing the basic biological information that partners need to formulate adaptive management strategies.The overall objective of this project is to provide the scientific foundation for conserving terrestrial plants, wildlife, and habitats by developing the basic biological information that partners need to formulate adaptive management strategies. In 2001, BLM, USGS, and APHIS convened a series of expert panels to consider research needs related to the wild horse and burro program. Topics examined included (1) health and handling issues, (2) fertility control, (3) population estimation and modeling, (4) population genetics, and (5) habitat assessment and population goals. Based on the deliberations of these panels and information from a number of other sources, it was concluded that BLMs most pressing needs were in the areas of fertility control and population estimation; thus, the basic objectives of current USGS research on wild horses and burros are to (1) test the efficacy of one or more fertility control agents in regulating the growth of wild horse populations (wild burro populations generally grow more slowly than wild horse populations, and excess burros are adopted more easily), and (2) to develop efficient and defensible techniques for estimating populations of wild horses and burros. As work on these objectives is concluded, additional research topics may be added in the other areas considered by the expert panels.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle SpayVac Research\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem As the primary agency responsible for management of wild horses on U.S. public lands, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a need for a long-lasting agent to control their reproduction. Given the protection afforded by The Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act (P.L. 92195) and general lack of natural predators, wild horse populations can often increase at rates of 1520% per year and quickly exceed the carrying capacity of their ranges. In the past, BLM has managed excess horses through a gather, removal, and adoption program, but the adoption demand for horses has decreased significantly in recent years. An additional approach being used by BLM is to reduce reproductive rates in wild horse herds through the application of contraceptive agents. A limitation of the agents currently available for investigational use is that they are of relatively short duration. SpayVac has recently been shown to have potential for long-lasting efficacy in wild horses. Duration of effectiveness is especially important in wild horses, which in most cases must be captured in order to successfully administer the contraceptives. Further testing of SpayVac thus seems warranted. The purpose of this task is for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to conduct research for BLM to evaluate the efficacy of SpayVac as a contraceptive in wild horses.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Objective 2. The study will be conducted under the auspices of a grant from USGS to Oregon State University. Twenty-eight healthy and reproductively sound mares between the ages of 3 and 15 years and either purchased or received as donor animals will be used for this research. Horses will be housed for 7 months at Cowboy Creek Ranch located 20 minutes southeast of Salem, Oregon.  Animals will have access to pastures, be provided shelter and fed daily with alfalfa hay, and a salt/mineral block and water will be available at all times.  Each horse will be given an initial physical examination, which will include prophylactic deworming with a generic ivermectin oral paste (one tube/1,250 pounds of body weight), drawing 10 mL of blood from the jugular vein for tests to determine complete blood counts (CBC) and serum chemistry panels (as well as pre-vaccination pZP antibody titers and steroid hormone concentrations), and baseline ovarian and follicle measurements will be made via transrectal palpation and ultrasonography.Following collection of baseline samples and images, 28 mares will be randomly divided into 4 experimental groups (n=7 each) and receive a single gluteal or hip intramuscular 1 mL injection of one of three SpayVac/adjuvant formulations or an equal volume of saline solution with or without adjuvant. Jugular venous blood samples (10 mL) will be collected from each mare at 2-week intervals for 7 months to determine serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone as well as pZP antibody titers.  Physical examination of injections sites will also be made to note potential signs of inflammation.  Transrectal ultrasonography will be performed monthly to image reproductive organs and once estrous cyclicity has been determined, timed to image ovarian function around the time of ovulation.  This will require palpation every other day to determine time of ovulation during 4 months of the breeding season (April through July).  At the end of the 7-month study period, final ovarian and follicle measurements will be made again via transrectal palpation and ultrasonography, and blood samples to determine CBC and serum chemistries will be collected.  Fourteen mares (7 from the treatment group demonstrating the most promising pZP antibody titers and 7 controls) will then be humanely euthanized using an overdose of phenobarbital (1 mL/10 pounds of body weight) administered into the jugular vein (3 per day).  The remaining mares will be put up for adoption, donated, or sold at auction.  Following euthanasia, complete necropsy examinations will be performed, and direct measurements of reproductive tracts will be recorded and compared against results obtained by ultrasound.   Samples of injections sites, lymph nodes, reproductive organs, lung, liver, heart, kidney, mammary gland, and pituitary will be collected for histology.  Ovarian sections will be evaluated by immunohistochemistry to determine binding characteristics of anti-pZP IgG antibodies to the zona pellucida.Objective 4. Specific aims of this study will be to 1) quantify the effectiveness of SpayVac in preventing pregnancy and foaling over 5 breeding seasons post-treatment; 2) determine the relationship between PZP antibody titers and pregnancy status; and 3) monitor injection-related and other potential side effects of SpayVac.Treatment groups of 30 mares each will receive one of two formulations of SpayVac or a sham (saline) injection (90 mares total). Mares will be assigned to one of three 30-acre pastures in a stratified-random fashion such that each pasture has equal representation of all treatments. Stallions will be introduced into each pasture for breeding purposes. Blood samples will be drawn at regular intervals for titer analysis and pregnancy testing. Mares will also be closely observed for foaling.Methodologies for the other objectives are to be determined. A study plan or scope of work will be developed for each of the major objectives.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle GnRH: Evaluation of the immunocontraceptive agent on the behavioral ecology of wild horses at Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North Dakota\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Wild horses are federally protected by the Wild Free-Roaming Wild Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (Public Law 92195, as amended).  This legislation has presented the somewhat unique challenge of managing a highly fecund, yet protected, species on finite areas of public land.  Scientific research aimed at addressing this problem have been devoted to developing wildlife antifertility agents that are safe, practical, and effective. The primary focus on this topic from FORT scientists has been investigation of the immunocontraceptive Porcine Zona Pellucida (PZP) for limiting fecundity of wild horses on public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  The National Park Service (NPS) also manages wild horses on public lands, and like the BLM, faces the challenge of maintaining populations of a fecund protected species within resource limits.  In recent years, a promising new fertility control agent has been developed that may overcome many of the shortcomings of current technology and involves immunization against gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). Scientists with US Department of Agricultures (USDA), Wildlife Services National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) have recently conjugated synthetic GnRH peptides to a highly immunogenic carrier protein that, when combined with a potent adjuvant, stimulates the hosts immune system to produce antibodies that bind to endogenous GnRH. As anti-GnRH antibodies decline over time, concentrations of available endogenous GnRH increase and treated animals usually regain fertility. Although not thoroughly evaluated, this immunocontraceptive vaccine, known by the trade name as GonaCon, has been shown to provide multiple years of infertility in several wild ungulate species including horses, bison (Bison bison), elk (Cervus elaphus), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). While initial results are promising, many unanswered questions must be addressed before this potential contraceptive agent can be considered an acceptable method of fertility control in wild horses.  To this end, managers at Theodore Roosevelt National Park (THRO), North Dakota, in cooperation with NPS and CSU scientists, initiated a field study by inoculating 28 female horses with GonaConTM and 28 control females with saline in the fall of 2009.  Their intent is to monitor these horses for general health, pregnancy, and body condition through 2011.  One critical component identified by the BLM and expert committees (convened 2001), and subsequently by NPS, in evaluating a fertility control agent for large-scale use is the potential influence it may have on the behavioral ecology of the species.  FORT scientists have developed the quantitative tools (see BASIS Project 3210AKF, task 5 products) for evaluating this topic and propose to investigate the influence of GnRH contraception on behavior of wild horses in THRO in concert with the larger efficacy study.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will evaluate and compare the effects of GnRH vaccine on reproductive behaviors and activity patterns of experimental females during AprilSeptember 2010. We will use a restricted randomized design to balance observations as much as possible among all experimental and control animals while also trying to observe the behaviors of each female 68 times per month. We will locate bands by vehicle or foot and conduct sampling observations from distances of 50300 m with the aid of binoculars and spotting scopes. We will use a combination of instantaneous scan sampling procedures to record time budget data and all-occurrence sampling to record reproductive behaviors of experimental and control horses. We will follow field and analytical methods described by Ransom and Cade (2009) to develop a herd-specific ethogram for selected behaviors at THRO.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program Element and Goal: Wildlife, #1 - Provide the Scientific Foundation for the Conservation of Terrestrial Plants, Wildlife, and Habitats by developing the basic biological information that partners need to formulate adaptive management strategies.The overall objective of this project is to provide the scientific foundation for conserving terrestrial plants, wildlife, and habitats by developing the basic biological information that partners need to formulate adaptive management strategies. The primary objectives of this research are to: 1) determine the effect of GnRH vaccine on socio-sexual behavior and social- spatial relationships, and 2) determine the effect of GnRH vaccine on activity budgets of feral horses (thus linking body condition evaluations with behavior and treatment regimen).     A secondary objective of this study is to add considerable depth to the on-going FORT wild horse project, which provides science support for the BLM National Wild Horse and Burro Program, by contributing to the full evaluation of a second promising fertility control agent and expanding the range of FORT wild horse research to include NPS lands.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan The primary products of this research are articles in peer-reviewed journals and papers presented at scientific meetings.  An admistrative report and presentation will be also prepared at the end of the study to ensure that relevant findings can be incorporated into NPS management strategies as early as possible.  In addition, findings from this study will be shared with the BLM, APHIS, and USGS working group on the larger fertility control study (3210AKF, task 5).\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Conservation of the Asiatic Wild Ass\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem a.Estimating abundance is one of the most important tasks in the conservation and management of wildlife species because it defines the need and scope of human action. While managers and practitioners in developed countries often have access to aircraft and technology to help accomplish this task, many of the worlds endangered and threatened fauna exist in remote undeveloped areas where terrestrial access, technology, aircraft availability, and human resources are extremely limited.   Wildlife in such areas can decline rapidly without detection and the needed conservation plans and action may be implemented too late, if at all.   This is this case with the Asiatic Wild Ass (Equus hemionus), a globally endangered species (International Union of Conservation and Nature Red List, 2010) and an Appendix II species of the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES). This species is thought to have declined in number by more than 50% over the past 16 years , and the Gobi region of Mongolia is believed to be the last stronghold for the species. Well-informed abundance estimates are needed to direct conservation plans and prompt action for these remaining populations.  This study is developing a community-based initiative for estimating khulan abundance in the Great Gobi B SPA using a large-scale simultaneous point-count across the entire area, and subsequently modeling the count data to generate well-informed estimates of abundance. This initiative serves as a functional model for integrating local people into scientific and conservation projects, which in turn creates vested interest in conservation by the people who are most influential in, and most affected by, the outcomes.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology A simultaneous point count will be implemented across the Great Gobi B SPA, Mongolia using paired observers at 50 elevated points on the landscape. These observers will collect data independently in an effort to measure observer bias (in a mark-resight framework). Distance, direction to each animal group, and various covariate data associated with each detected group will also be collected.  Multiple surveys will occur at 2 hour intervals for a total of 6 surveys per observation point.  Final data will be analyzed in a distance sampling framework to generate an estimate of density, which will be extrapolated to a population estimate for the park.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The objectives of this study are:1. To develop a working model for abundance estimation of Asiatic Wild Ass in Mongolia, using a team of local residents trained in data collection.2. To generate an estimate of abundance that can provide a scientifically-derived set of values for use in local and international species action plans for conservation.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Radio Collar Development for wild horses and burros\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Radio collars and other radio telemetry devices (radio-tags) have been invaluable tools for wildlife managers for over 40 years. Data gained from radio collars have provided a greater understanding of wildlife movement rates, spatial ecology, habitat selection, and seasonal habitat ranges. When placed on females, radio collars enable scientists to track individuals and learn about population reproductive rates, survival rates, and other demographic parameters such as immigration and emigration. They have been used to mark individuals in aerial surveys, improving the precision and accuracy of population estimates. This essential tool has been used for research on virtually all North American native ungulates, but radio-tagging has rarely been used on feral horses or burros. Few published studies have used collars on equids, with no published studies on collared horses or burros in the United States from the past 10 years. Due to the high visibility and public interest in wild horses and burros, we propose a study to radio collar horses and burros in a holding facility, so that the best design for equids can be identified and any effects of collars on neck wear can be investigated in a controlled environment. We propose to develop and test several radio collars and radio tagging devices, to develop a suitable and safe system that can be used efficiently to mark and track feral horses and burros.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will follow these general steps in our study:1.  Thoroughly investigate collar designs used in both USA and abroad. Contact researchers in Australia, Africa, Europe, and Mongolia who have collared equids, to inquire about collaring impacts, fit, wear, and overall satisfaction with collars.2. Obtain, develop, and/or modify and improve collar designs that seem worthy of testing.3. Deploy collars on captive horses and burros and test them for fit and wear intensively over a 3 month period. Attach tail and mane radio tags to see if they will remain on the animal (as opposed to being chewed or rubbed off) and test their functionality.4.  Collect behavior data on treatment and control animals intensely for a 3 month period.5. Analyze data and submit results for publication with recommendations and a description of what we have learned from the 3 month trial. 6. Leave collars/tags on experimental animals for an additional 9 months, checking long term wear of collars/tags biweekly or monthly to confirm that no severe negative impacts develop over time. 7. At the end of the year, develop USGS standard operating procedures (SOPs) for collaring or tagging horses and burros.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Objectives:1.Conduct a thorough investigation into available collar designs made in the USA and abroad, and inquire about their fit and wear on wild equids.2.Obtain prototypes of several radio collar designs that are the most promising in terms of their expected success for fit and wear.  Work with companies to develop or modify a collar design based on what we learn. Also purchase a radio tag that can be tied into the mane and on the tail to compare the longevity and efficacy of simple radio tags and radio collars.3.Observe and intensively monitor neck wear and fit of collars on captive horses and burros for 3 months, followed by less intensive monitoring for an additional 9 months.4.Collect behavior data on treatment (collared/tagged) and control (uncollared) horses and burros for 3 months to determine if collars or tags cause significant changes in individual behavior of horses or burros.5.Determine if radio collars or tags applied to feral horses or burros cause welfare problems in the form of negative physical or behavioral effects from collars or tags.6.Report to BLM on the results of the 3-month trial. Continue to monitor collars/tags on experimental individuals to evaluate longer-term fit and wear for an additional 9 months; report to BLM on these longer-term results.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan At the end of the 3 month intensive trial, we will prepare a report for BLM to let them know the most suitable model(s). At the end of December 2015, we will prepare a manuscript for submission to a peer-reviewed journal; to be submitted sometime in fy16.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Modeling carrying capacity of free-roaming horses\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Understanding the ability of ecosystems to support grazers is important for landscape management in the western USA. Predictive modeling of free-roaming horse population carrying capacities is essential to determine the number of individuals that can be supported and maintained on an HMA. Current and future populations of feral horses will continue to impact the range, while forage levels are likely to be reduced due to the effects of climate change. Global climate change is already resulting in increasing temperatures and less predictable precipitation. In the western United States the result will likely be greater aridity and less productive vegetation in HMAs, and increasing competition for forage among livestock and wild and feral ungulates. We propose to develop a model to calculate a sustainable carrying capacity of feral horses within a specified HMA or HMA complex, and to test our model predictions against empirical data that quantifies and categorizes habitat condition. In this way we can identify inadequacies in our model assumptions and revise accordingly. Also, we will use our model to predict horse carrying capacity under different climate change scenarios.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Our methods will follow Wockner et al. (2009), a carrying capacity model using straightforward forage accounting theory, with calculations based on transparent arithmetic. All calculations will be done in ModelBuilder in ArcGIS using data layers represented as grids (rasters) and polygons.  We will create a custom toolbox of analysis steps with ModelBuilder, with tools that may be used by co-investigators or others to conduct additional analyses in a timely way. We will start by assessing the extent of the study area on which to focus the model. Discussions with BLM managers will define the geographic spatial area of the model to determine whether it will be at a landscape level, an HMA complex level, or within a specific HMA.We will use GIS raster-based layers called grids and vector-based layers called polygons to conduct calculations in the model. Each subtraction involves a grid subtracted from a grid while summing involves adding up all the forage shown in a grid that falls within a designated polygon. Model calculations follow the following sequence:1.Start with the amount of vegetation production (ANPP) on the entire study area or HMA or HMA complex.2.Calculate Habitat Sustainability Threshold  the amount of vegetation production that must not be grazed, at 3 threshold levels. Subtract these values to calculate the grid of remaining vegetation production available for ungulates.3.Subtract livestock offtake.4.Subtract offtake from other wild ungulates  mule deer, pronghorn, and/or others.5.Calculate how much vegetation remains inside of the HMA or HMA complex.6.Decide if some areas of the HMA should be removed from calculations of forage because they are too far from water and are not really suitable horse habitat (consult BLM experts).7.Using the thresholds defined in #2, calculate how many horses can be fed for 12 months with the amount of vegetation in #5, where horses are assumed to have an average weight of 1100 lbs (although horse weight may be modified). This final value represents the carrying capacity for horses at the low, mid-point, and high threshold levels of grazing.8.Compare model results with current AML on the HMA. Inquire what have been the actual horse population values for the preceding 10 years if available, and use habitat indicators from BLMs AIM monitoring program (vegetation cover and composition, bare ground, intercanopy gaps, soil stability; MacKinnon et al. 2011) to ascertain if habitat conditions, and model predictions (and current AML) are in agreement.  If not, steps can be taken to adjust the model and/or adjust AML based on habitat conditions (Figure 1)9.Use final model to incorporate various scenarios for climate change that alter the amount of available forage on the landscape, or alter the habitat sustainability thresholds, or both, to see how horse carrying capacity is affected. Proposed climate scenarios will come from literature searches for the study area geographic region, as applied to specific habitat types found in the landscape, HMA, or HMA complex.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Our objectives are to:1.Develop a carrying capacity model for feral horses that can be applied to specific HMAs and HMA complexes.2.Use empirical data collected by BLMs vegetation Assessment, Inventory and Monitoring (AIM, Toevs et al. 2011) program to assess ecological condition of the modeled HMA as a test of our model predictions. 3.Incorporate different climate change scenarios into our model inputs to examine a range of potential impacts on horse carrying capacity.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Burro Census Techniques\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Wild burros are notoriously difficult to count accurately. They have cryptically colored pelage, stand still when overflown, and are often in small groups or solo. These and other characteristics decrease the probability of detecting burros on aerial surveys. The simultaneous double-count technique for aerial surveys is expected to produce inaccurate population estimates for burros because there is an unknown, but probably substantial, fraction of the population that is never available to be seen by any of the observers. We propose to quantify those otherwise-invisible burros using a hybrid analysis method that incorporates the simultaneous double-count technique, sighting covariates, and observations from radio-marked animals.  We aim to develop our population estimation model across a range of burro populations and habitat types to develop a broadly applicable model that can be applied at other HMAs where burros occur so long as observers use standard simultaneous double-count techniques during surveys.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology In 1999, the Arizona Burro Census Team reviewed the pros and cons of 8 different potential aerial estimation techniques (Little and Grissom 1999).  At that time, some burro population estimates were based on mark-resight of paint marked animals.  Shooting burros with paintballs from a helicopter put government employees at risk during the paint marking, increased effort and costs, and may have changed burro behavior during the follow-up aerial surveys. As an alternative, Little and Grissom (1999) recommended two burro survey techniques for further research and testing: the simultaneous double-count technique (Caughley and Grice 1982, Graham and Bell 1989), and sightability modeling (Samuel et al. 1987, Unsworth et al. 1999).  We will pool these two methods to create a hybrid burro population estimation model.Developing the modelWe will coordinate with BLM (and USFS, if applicable) to identify three or more HMAs (or complexes) to conduct the research. The ideal HMAs for this study would have high burro populations where there is an impending need for a population count, and in which burros can be readily captured 1-3 months before surveys.  We intend to deploy radio-telemetry on 15-20 burro groups in each of 3 HMAs.      Before using radio-collars or ear tags on wild burros, we will be testing their safety on 3-5 captive burros in a concurrent study being conducted by USGS, commencing in fall 2014 and results expected in January 2015.  Unless burro health is compromised, we will use radio collars. If only the ear tags can guarantee animal health, we will use those for telemetry.We will request federal VHF radio frequencies in an available wildlife research bandwidth, and which do not conflict with frequencies used by other agencies or tribes.  We will use ground-based telemetry or potentially conduct brief fixed-wing telemetry flights to confirm that there is no other signal interference on the selected frequencies. USGS will rely on BLM (and USFS, if applicable) staff for wild burro capture and handling operations.  USGS staff will be on hand to assist with radio collar fitting or ear tag application. On aerial survey days, we will use GPS positions from radio-collared burros, received via satellite link, to determine which burros are in the survey area and which were missing from the area at the time of survey. If we must use ear tag transmitters, then we will conduct an airplane flight to determine the approximate location of each tagged burro, and whether each one either will or will not be within the survey area.      The USGS aerial survey specialist will train observers in simultaneous double-count observation methods if needed.  A USGS observer will be on each survey flight to help with data collection and radio-telemetry. All survey flights will follow planned flight lines that ensure complete and systematic coverage of the entire HMA or complex.  We will record the helicopters flight path with the pilots GPS unit, and with a second GPS unit as a backup. Observers will use the simultaneous double-count method for observations and data recording.  Whenever a burro group is detected observers will use a third GPS unit to mark a waypoint, and will record sighting covariates: group size, amount of vegetative cover, and topographic barriers near the group.  Whenever possible, we will take digital photographs of the group with an image-stabilized zoom lens.      During the course of surveys, we will be recording a large number of burro groups with no radio collars. In order to develop the model, we will need to record 80-100 observations of groups with radio-marked burros, or alternatively burro groups that are also monitored by ground-based observers. Data from these known burro groups that were either seen during survey, or missed during survey, will allow us to quantify that part of the population that goes undetected due to heterogeneity bias.  Testing the model\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Please note that this study will require the use of radio collars, being tested in a study in early fy15.Objectives for the burro study are:1. Fit 15-20 burros with radio collars or, if needed, telemetry ear tags, at each of 3 HMAs with high burro populations.  2.

Removing males from the reproductive population through gelding is an alternative potential management tool, but there is no published information on the effects of this on wild horse behavior, range use, or whether there will be a measureable impact on population growth. We aim to quantify the impact of gelding male horses on their behavior and ecology at the scale of both the individual and population, examining individual-level effects by comparing behavior of the same animals pre- and post-treatment, and population-level effects by comparing the treated population with an untreated population in a paired Herd Management Area (HMA) with similar habitat and herd size.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Free-roaming horses on North American public lands are protected by the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, which limits available management options. Wild horses have the potential for population growth rates up to 25%. To date the primary management tool of wild horse specialists has been removal of wild horses to holding facilities in which animals are made available for public adoption. Alternative management tools to removals or short-term contraception are needed to moderate the population growth of wild horses. We propose to examine the impact of spaying on individual mares, exploring any changes in their behavior and band fidelity, demography (birth and survival rates), and spatial ecology (from radio collars or radio tags) both pre- and post-treatment. We will also evaluate the population-level effect (growth rate) of having a proportion of spayed females in a population by comparison with an untreated population in a paired Herd Management Area (HMA). USGS will convene a panel of experts to assess available spay techniques and considerations required for use in field conditions and on wild mares as opposed to domestic mares. BLM will use input from this panel in deciding which spay method to use in the study.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem BLM wild horse and burro managers need a population model that has the capability to evaluate population dynamics of free-roaming horses and compare population growth reduction options, scenarios, and treatment costs. To date, BLM wild horse and burro specialists have used WinEquus (often referred to as the Jenkins Model, 1993) to predict population growth rates under management with fertility control (immunocontraception) in order to determine the best management prescriptions to achieve a herd size objective. This model served BLM well over several decades, but is now in need of updating and revising, as well as an expansion of its capabilities. Specifically, BLM now has multiple management tools at its disposal to manage the population growth of wild horse and burro herds. Managers need a way to compare various management actions/scenarios, evaluate simulated outcomes, and compare costs of management treatment scenarios. We propose the development of a new web or desktop application of this model.  We will call this revised and expanded model WinEquus II.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The new model will consist of:1.A population model with capabilities similar to the original WinEquus (Jenkins 1993), which can predict herd growth rates and other population dynamics parameters. Empirical data on the demography of 2 wild horse herds in varying habitat types is being collected from 2015-2020 by USGS and will be added to the software to improve model simulations.2. The new model will have the ability to compare various management treatments aimed at population growth reduction, and predict outcomes in terms of herd growth rates or herd population size at a future date, in a table format. It needs to be a multi-variate model (not just one-treatment-at-a-time assessment). We will include a way to add cost localization to allow the user to input their local treatment costs in the modeling.3.Treatments may include fertility control with porcine zona pellucida (PZP), SpayVac, GonaCon (gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH]), or other agents and will include consideration of mares that are coming off fertility control vaccines if not retreated. The model will include management scenarios such as herd sex ratio manipulations, animal removals, gelding a portion of males, spaying a portion of females, and the presence of a non-reproducing component of the population. 4.The model will include demographic and environmental stochasticity. 5.Model output will include horse population by age-class under various fertility control or other treatment scenarios and potentially show differences in population growth rate when fertility control or other treatments are applied to different age classes. It is important to note here that modeling doesnt predict a specific and certain outcome, but a range of possibilities with some more likely than others. Outcomes are probabilistic, not definitive, but are still highly valuable for guiding management.6.Managers will have the ability to step into the modeling backwards; that is, managers could input what they would like the population size outcome to be and the amount of funding they have, and the model could provide a number of management scenarios to achieve the desired outcome, using various population growth reduction treatments and management actions.  We may include genetics as a qualifying consideration, so that, for example, no more than 50% of females in a herd should be spayed, if the management goal is to retain genetic variation. These types of options will be discussed with BLM during model development.7.All demographic parameters and model inputs shall be transparent and easily viewed by the user, including herd birth rates and the survival rates that were used as inputs. Management treatments for each model run should also be easily viewed by the user. The model shall include the ability to compare treatments and costs of each treatment scenario and population outcomes in one easily-interpretable comparative table, and allow decision makers to compare management scenarios.8.We will provide reports that are easy to digest such as publication-quality outputs in a format that can be easily integrated (cut and pasted) into HMA planning documents if needed.9.All of the inputs and parameters for each model run will be saved in a consolidated and fully documented format.  This will facilitate transparency, reproducibility, model sharing.  The schema for this output will adhere to existing standards.10.The project will include a final Users Guide, as well as training for BLM managers, wild horse specialists, and BLM IT staff on programming and application of the model and software, to be conducted by USGS developers/IT specialists.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Burro Sentinel Demography\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Burros are a domesticated variety of the African wild ass, brought to America by the Spaniards. They are protected under the 1971 Wild Horse and Burro Act (Public Law 92-195). There is remarkably little published literature on the wild burro, despite our long association with them as a domesticated species. Almost all the research conducted on wild burros was in the 1970s and 1980s, and there are even fewer studies on the African wild ass. Management of burros has been impaired by this lack of knowledge, particularly because what little research has been conducted indicates that they are both socially and behaviorally very different from wild horses, and exhibit different habitat use and diet. The National Academies of Science (NAS) recommended acquiring population ecology information on burros to better inform their management (National Research Council 2013). We propose to conduct a descriptive study of the demographic parameters of wild burro populations inhabiting 1) a Sonoran Desert ecosystem in Arizona, and 2) a badlands ecosystem in Utah. We propose to measure fertility, fecundity, recruitment of foals, age-class survival and mortality of burro jennies, habitat selection, movement ecology, and habitat range of jennies. We propose to build a state-space Bayesian model to predict the environmental attributes driving survival and population growth of wild burros, as well as a habitat selection model.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology As part of a previously funded and approved proposal (Developing and testing aerial survey techniques for wild burros), we will deploy radio-collars on 25-30 burro jennies across each of the two HMAs (n= 50-60 collars total). Radio collars have long signal transmission ranges and battery lives (3-5 years), and have been used on burros in the USA (Seegmiller and Ohmart 1981) and Western Australia (Woolnough et al. 2012, M. Elliott, Dept. of Agriculture and Food Western Australia, pers. comm.). Radio collars will remain on burros for up to 4.5 years, at which time they will be scheduled to fall off with a timed release mechanism.We will conduct ground monitoring of radio collared females at least every other week during summer (March-August) and at least 1x/month in winter (Sept-Feb) to check collars, check for foals, and obtain survival and location data during each year of the study period. We will collect fecal samples from marked females in late autumn each year to determine pregnancy status, and locate them in March-August to ascertain foaling success . We will document the sex ratio of new foals by sexing individuals visually, using binoculars or a scope if needed. Because we are not able to radio track and individually identify males (other than the routine freeze mark applied by BLM), we are not able to determine survival, habitat selection, and movements of males. However we will collect some behavior data on males at Sinbad, when they are associated with marked jennies .\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Goal:The goal of our research is to conduct a descriptive study of the demographic parameters of two wild burro populations inhabiting different ecosystems to provide empirical data for population modeling, to improve management of wild burros, and to contribute to a better understanding of the ecology of the species.  Objectives:1.To measure the basic demographic parameters of two wild burro populations; one in a Sonoran desert ecosystem in Arizona, and the other in Utah badlands. Parameters include fertility, fecundity, recruitment to age 1, age-class survival and mortality, habitat selection, movement ecology, and habitat range. 2.To quantify the behavior of female burros in order to provide better information about social dynamics and reproductive behavior of burros.3.To build a state-space Bayesian model to predict environmental factors that have the greatest influence on burro demographic parameters; specifically aimed at determining environmental attributes that drive survival and population growth of wild burros.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Wild Horse Sentinel Demography.\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Wild horse populations inhabit much of the western U.S. but compared to the published literature on the population dynamics, ecology, and ecosystem function of native North American ungulates, little research has been done on wild horse ecology. This lack of information has limited wild horse managers, because understanding demography is important for predictive modeling, making management decisions, understanding habitat needs and environmental limitations. In addition, the National Academies of Science report (National Research Council 2013) focused on the need for science-based management of free-roaming equids and highlighted the utility of statistical models for this approach. The committee recommended models for predicting population growth rates of wild horses, and also for ecosystem modeling. Yet little empirical data exists on which to build such models. We propose to conduct a descriptive study of 2 wild horse populations to measure their core demographic parameters. These studies will provide empirical data for population and ecosystem modeling, to improve management of wild horses, and to contribute to a better understanding of the ecology of wild horses. We will measure fertility, fecundity, recruitment, age-specific survival and mortality, habitat selection, movements, and habitat range of wild horses. We will use these data to build a state-space Bayesian model to predict environmental factors that have the greatest influence on demographic parameters (what drives survival and rate of increase of wild horses, for example), and to improve, update, and revise the WinEquus population model used by wild horse specialists.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology After NEPA approval is obtained, wild horses will be gathered at both HMAs and populations will be reduced to AML, with a 50:50 sex ratio and a population representing all age classes. While in the squeeze chute all animals to be turned out to the range will have a few hairs plucked for genetic analyses, be given a freeze mark on their neck with a unique BLM identifier using the International Alpha Angle System, with the last four digits of this identifier freeze-marked on their left croup (conducted as part of BLM policy). Thirty mares of varying ages will be fitted with collars and 30 stallions of varying ages and harem status will be fitted with mane and/or tail tags. Horses returned to the range will be selected randomly based on age (to include all age classes), sex, and stallion status; the remainder (above AML) will be removed for adoption. We will also remove any individuals that have cryptorchidism, inguinal hernia, club feet, or any other congenital or heritable defects following BLM policy (BLM IM 2009-063).We acknowledge that not all individuals will be brought in during the gather, but because our study is focusing on a subset or sample of the population it will not affect our study design.During the gather we will fit horses with Global Positioning System (GPS) and/or Very High Frequency (VHF) radio collars or radio tags. Following the results of a preliminary captive trial at the BLM Pauls Valley adoption facility in Oklahoma, we will only be placing radio collars on females. Stallions will be tracked with GPS and/or VHF radio transmitter tags that will be braided in to their tails and manes and held in place with a non-toxic, low temperature curing epoxy resin. Collars will be placed on up to 30 adult females (&#8805;3 years old based on tooth wear estimation) that have a Henneke body condition score of 4 or greater (i.e., moderately thin and fatter; Henneke et al. 1983), stratified by adult age class (3-5, 6-9, >10 years old). This is considered a normal level of body condition for horses that are at athletic fitness or living in wild conditions. Animals that are thin (Henneke score of &#8804;3), deformed, or who have any apparent neck problems will not be fitted with a collar. As tags are small (<200g) and are not worn around the neck they are considered of low burden to the animal, and therefore could potentially be worn by animals in lower body condition; 30 stallions to be fitted with mane and tail tags will be selected randomly from within age and status categories. All personnel involved in handling animals will have previously completed the BLMs Comprehensive Animal Welfare Program (CAWP) training. The design and vendor of collar will be based on the results of the ongoing USGS radio collar and tag study at the BLM Pauls Valley adoption facility in Oklahoma. Placing radio collars and radio tags on horses at Frisco and Little Colorado HMAs will constitute our first field test of radio collars in wild as opposed to captive conditions. To ensure that there are no impacts on animal welfare, all individuals wearing a collar will be visually observed once a month during winter (September to Feb), and every two weeks during foaling/breeding season (March to August). We will conduct ground monitoring of radio collared females every week during the breeding and foaling season (March-August) and 1-2x/month in the non-foaling season (Sept-Feb) to check collars, check for foals, and obtain survival and location data during each year of the study period (see 2. Specific Aims for schedule). Males will also be located by ground observation &#8805;2x/month in the foaling season and &#8805;1x/month in winter (Sep-Feb) to record locations and survival. We will collect fecal samples from marked females in late autumn each year to determine pregnancy status, and locate them in March-August to ascertain foaling success.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Elk and bison grazing ecology in Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Little is known about the growing elk herd in the newly established Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve (GRSA). The new park is poised to develop an ungulate management plan with 3-4 other agencies, but needs reliable scientific information in order to make science-based management decisions.  The elk are a rare and unique herd ocupying a dunes complex of land, with part of the herd migrating and part of the herd remaining non-migratory.  In an effort to avoid a growing potential elk problem similar to that in Estes Park/Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, resource managers at GRSA requested a multi-year, multi-species study of ungulates in and around the park.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Our overall strategy is to collect data on ungulates via radio-tracking (Study Element I) and effects of ungulates on vegetation (Study Element II),and use those results to conduct ecological modeling (Study Element III).  This is a comprehensive study to evaluate ecosystem processes, not single species.  Methods of each part of the study are outlined below:Elk Distribution and Habitat Use.  Monitor 65 adult radio collared elk in conjunction with CDOW. Elk are located  twice per month via fixed wing survey and 1x/month via random ground survey to determine extent and range of movements. We are estimating elk population size by flying an aerial survey in winter and recording sighting variables for a correction. We will plot elk groups to determine distribution. Elk Population Size and Dynamics.  We will estimate elk population size by flying aerial surveys in winter and recording sighting variables. We will provide a basis for improved abundance estimates for this population. Sightability bias correction models have been developed (Samuel et al. 1987); Unsworth et al 1994; Lubow et al. 2002) and tested for other elk herds (National Bison Range, Starkey Research Area). Existing models require collection of additional covariates such as group size, snow cover, and tree cover. We will gather the required variables and apply these to raw counts to improve population estimates. We will combine our unbiased estimates of population size with existing calf production and yearling recruitment rates samples by CDOW to provide a basis for a simple population model to this elk herd. About 15 years of helicopter data is available for the entire elk herd. We will fit a series of alternative hypothesized models to the available data using maximum likelihood estimation and select the most appropriate, parsimonious model from the set using Akaikes Information Criterion (Burnham and Anderson 2002). We will calculate the rate of population increase (lambda) and attempt to identify evidence for density dependence, particularly in calf recruitment. Correlation of appropriate weather covariates with annual recruitment can be explored. If possible, we will estimated food-limited carrying capacity from the population growth trajectory following procedures described in Lubow et al. (2002) and White and Lubow (2002). Bison Habitat Use and Distribution.  Fourteen bison (10 female, 4 male) will be radio-collated during routine round-up operations. We will place GPS/radio collars on 4 bison for frequent monitoring and better habitat use information.  We will track bison on foot and locate all collars each week.Vegetation and Management Studies.  We errected 24 new ungulate proof exclosures; 8 cottonwood, 8 in willow, 8 in wet meadow (especially spiderflower sites). Additional methods are available in our study plan.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: TERRESTRIAL, FRESHWATER AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS, #2 - Model factors controlling ecosystem patterns at various scales and develop decision support systems which integrate this information with management options.Our objectives are to (1)determine the current population status of elk, and current year-round distribution and movements of elk; (2) evaluate the effects of bison and elk herbivory on plant communities, especially on shrub and tree recruitment, not only from browsing, but also from rubbing and thrashing; (3) determine the suitable habitat and population potential (ecological carrying capacity) for elk on Nature Conservancy lands, in the Park Unit, the Preserve Unit, the U.S. National Forest Units, and the new national refuge lands;(4) provide information for developing a predictive model to be used in a planning process for management agencies, and lay out management scenarios to predict effects on ungulate populations, changes in population size, habitat selection, and migrations; (5) monitor the effects of treatments and new experiments on the distribution and movements of elk.  (6) evaluate the effect of bison grazing on soil nitrogen processes; (7) evaluate the interaction of climate and ungulate herbivory on cottonwood and willow through establishment and analysis of recruitment dates (using dendrochronology) and correlations to water tables and precipitation patterns; and (8) determine the genetic variability in the current Medano-Zapata bison herd.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan We will submit an Investigator's Annual Report (IAR) to the park service each year.  We will also complete a final report at the end of the study, and submit research findings to peer-reviewed journals for publication. Results of this project will also be written up in a dissertation by Kate Schoenecker for PhD degree.We will make a minimum of 1 presentation/year to the agencies' to report on the status of the project and any relevant findings, and conduct a final presentation/close-out at the end of the study.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The study commenced in FY05, and we have collectd all years of data on elk and bison movements and are in the process of writing up results and presenting results.  Key findings indicate that elk are using a vast portion of the range, and the new game management unit established by CDOW (west of Hwy 17) has been successful in keeping elk out of agriculture fields, based on elk radio-collar location data (GPS collars) after 2006.Vegetation impacts from elk and bison herbivory are significant in willow sites, but fenced cottonwoods did not show any release after 3 years of no herbivory. We conclude ungulate herbivory is not driving the cottonwood lack of recruitment. This is consistent with hydrology results by D. Andersen. Herbaceous vegetation production was stimulated in grazed areas compared to exclosure plots showing evidence for grazing optimization; herbaceous production was significantly higher in areas grazed by elk, than those with no elk herbivory.   Key findings indicate the elk population size estimate is ~5000.  Bison herd size is ~1700.  Bison genetic sample analysis indicates the herd has low cattle hybridization (around 5%). So far we have not detected any differences in body condition of elk that migrate, versus those that do not.We are in the process of writing up research results from data collected from 2005-2009.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments We completed the data collection including: radio-collaring and tracking elk for 3+ years, radio-collaring bison for 3+ years and collecting genetic samples, exclosure site selection and vegetation collection for 3+ years, put out grazing cages at pasture sites on the bison range, biotechs collected data on animal locations, and the plant crew has collected data since June, 2005. IAR is done for 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and all elk population helicopter survey work is completed (2 full census population surveys). Alpine survey work for the USFS is completed and manuscript has been accepted (in press).  Results of the study were presented to Regional Directors of NPS and USFWS in Feb 2009, at TWS CO/Regional meeting in August 2009, to the Colorado Field Institute in March 2010, and to Science Team members in March 2010. Lead PIs Schoeencker and Zeigenfuss are paticipating in the Science Team to provide input on the development of an ungulate management plan for SLV.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Ecology of wolf reintroduction\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In much of the Greater Yellowstone region, riparian willows are key species.  There is evidence that riparian willow in Yellowstones northern winter range have declined the last 7-8 decades.  Willows present are often suppressed by browsing.  The intensity of browsing appears to vary by elevation with more extensive suppressed willow at lower elevations.  Willow height and extent affect microclimate, soil moisture, and ecosystem processes such as organic carbon and nitrogen production and mineralization rates.  Willows released from browsing can have a more direct effect on aquatic ecosystem chemical and physical properties through the input of dissolved and particulate organics, essential inorganic nutrients, and temperature.          The primary factor thought to affect browsing intensity on willow in the northern winter range is elk.  Park Service management of elk numbers in the northern range has been controversial for much of the 20th century.  Elk numbers were reduced by various means from the 1930s until 1968.  From about 1970 to 1995 elk numbers increased.  In 1995 wolves were reintroduced to the northern range.  There are several lines of evidence to suggest the presence of wolves may have reduced elk densities by 15-20% on the northern range in part by predation but primarily by elk redistribution.  A number of studies suggest the reduction in elk densities has already resulted in the release of other vegetation species as aspen.    Should the increased presence of wolves or other factors result in the release of riparian willow, this also improves the riparian value for beaver.  Beaver, now relatively scarce, also alter the flux and cycling of inorganic and organic nutrients of streams, riparian areas, and conterminous forest.  Willow, with their extensive root system and fast growth, are sensitive to both fluctuation in subsurface water levels and nutrient availability which will be altered by beaver.  So there are two states: one relatively stable and longer-term, with the other (elk) much less stable.  Both conditions have unique feedback loops.  A final major factor we must consider is the warming climate in the region.  Winters are warmer and drier which extends the growing season in spring, and allows soil temperatures to rise to thresholds earlier increasing the availability of limiting nutrients as nitrogen.  The goal of this 3-year study, begun in 2005, is to separate out the relative influence of the short- and longer-term factors listed above on riparian willow release.  This goal has been broken down into a set of specific objectives discussed below.  Keywords: riparian, willow, elk, wolf, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, biogeochemistry, trace gases, soil processes, climate change, Yellowstone,\n",
      "\t\tMethodology There are six pre-selected riparian study sites: three willow release sites (confluence of Lamar River and Soda Butte Creek [LSB], Crystal Creek [CC], and West Blacktail Lower [WBL]), and three suppressed sites (East Blacktail Upper [EBU], East Blacktail Lower [EBL], and West Blacktail Upper [WBU].  In addition, the suppressed sites are equipped with replicated elk exclosures and constructed dams to simulate potential effects of change in subsurface soil water levels (beaver) and herbivory.    Objectives #1 & 2.  To assess change in North Range willow coverage at the landscape-scale since 1995 there is the need to map current riparian willow distributions and growth history.  We will use pre- and post-1995 aerial imagery, previous willow thicket data collected by Singer, Zeigenfuss, and NPS coupled with additional intensive field sampling of willow thicket area and condition (released, suppressed, growth).  A library will be built of aerial \"signatures\" with ground measurements to extrapolate beyond points measured, with a statistical subset of the non-truthed sites then measured on the ground.  Objectives #3 & 4.  The focus here is on subsurface hydrology (wells, stream and well water height), soil and stream water inorganic and organic chemistry, above- and below-ground carbon and nitrogen pools (living, non-living biomass, soil), biomass production (willow stem analyses, litter fall, grass production), inorganic nitrogen pools (soil core extractions) carbon mineralization (soil CO2 efflux), nitrogen mineralization (monthly buried bags, seasonal resin exchange bags), soil trace gas (CO2, CH4, N2O, GC analyses) efflux in winter and during spring runoff.    Most of the chemical analyses are conducted at the FORT Bioanalysis lab.  Dissolved organics in stream and soil water are analyzed at Michigan Technological University, and trace gas samples with the Agricultural Research Service, Ft. Collins.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal - Wildlife, Goal 1: Provide the Scientific Foundation for the Conservation of Terrestrial Plants, Wildlife, and Habitats by developing the basic biological information that partners need to formulate adaptive management strategies.The primary study objectives are to 1) map the willows on the northern range, 2) re-survey the number of willow thickets formed since 1995 (post-wolf reintroduction) and compare with prior findings, 3) quantify the effects of willow thicket formation on plant community structure, microclimate, riparian nutrient input, soil carbon and nitrogen pools, and riparian contributions to the aquatic ecosystem, and 4) using replicated artificial beaver dams and elk exclosures, quantify the effects of variation in subsurface water levels and herbivory on basic riparian ecosystem processes.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Results each year will be presented at the Yellowstone Research Conference; one professional meeting a year; in an annual report and on average two publications.  See Products.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings We have not yet completed a full year of study.  To date the main finding (unpublished) for this semi-arid region is the importance of spring runoff and subsurface water level in affecting plant water and nutrient availability.  It appears riparian willow production is strongly linked to subsurface water levels which affect soil moisture into early and mid-summer.  Favorable moisture conditions coupled with rapidly warming and well-drained riparian soils in spring likely regulate much of the annual willow growth.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments We have completed the first year of study on objective #3, conducted some spring runoff study of the elk exclosures in objective #4, and outlined the approach to accomplish objectives #1 and 2.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Implementation of a monitoring plan for vegetation responses to new elk management in Rocky Mountain National Park\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The National Park Service (NPS), Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) and agencies responsible for management of land and wildlife resources adjacent to the park are in the process of developing and evaluating alternatives for managing elk and vegetation in and around Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. The goal of this planning effort is reduction of adverse effects of elk herbivory on vegetation, and decreasing conflicts between people and elk. The management actions implemented in response to this plan will attempt to restore the natural range of variability in both the elk population and affected plant communities.  An environmental impact statement (EIS) is in preparation to evaluate the effects of a range of management alternatives on the natural and human environment.  A record of decision is expected on this EIS in spring of 2007.  After that time, management actions prescribed by the plan will be implemented, and there will be a need to assess the effectiveness of such actions in accomplishing plan goals.  The park will need established monitoring locations as well as tested and cost-effective methods to monitor the response of the elk population and key vegetation communities to these management actions.  Baseline data from these monitoring sites by which to measure change over time will also be necessary.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology In 2001, USGS scientists designed an inventory and monitoring plan for RMNP(Stohlgren 2001) that included subplans which addressed monitoring of elk and their impacts on vegetation and monitoring of aspen. We will use these plans as the foundation to develop a revised monitoring plan for elk and vegetation. The monitoring plan will be developed in collaboration with park resources management staff to assure that it includes elements necessary to measure the impacts of the new elk management plan.  Methods and elements for monitoring will be selected with attention to their utility as inputs to the ecosystem model developed to assess the role of elk in the RMNP ecosystem. We will select vegetation monitoring sites and gather limited baseline data. The results of these activities will be incorporated into the monitoring plan, including identification of all vegetation monitoring sites, detailed protocols describing methods of vegetation monitoring, recommendations of sampling frequency and sample size for all monitoring elements, suggestions for statistical analyses/modeling of data collected as part of the monitoring program, and how to use the results of these analyses to measure success of management actions. Elk distribution data will used to create better distribution and density maps for elk on the Estes Valley winter range. Information from this analysis will be used to stratify the winter range for the purposes of selecting an appropriate array of vegetation monitoring sites.  We will use the new vegetation classification map for RMNP to determine which vegetation classes should be used combined to cover the 4 types of interest to this plan--aspen, willow, wet meadow, and upland grassland/meadow. Stratification of sites will be targeted at representing the range of elk distribution and density as well as focusing on areas that are most likely to be affected by proposed management. In this way, pre-treatment data could be collected by park staff immediately prior to implementation of any management actions. Number of samples will follow recommendations found in the earlier plan. A list of potential sites will be produced by the National Park Service Rocky Mountain Inventory and Monitoring Network so that there can be overlap, where possible, between the NPS monitoring network and Rocky Mountain National Parks vegetation monitoring. A field crew will begin locating proposed study sites in late summer 2006. When suitable sites are located, permanent survey stake markers will be placed at the site and will serve as photo-points, or other marking system as described by NPS protocols will be followed. The site locations will be recorded using a GPS. Grazing cages will be placed at the sites to measure winter herbaceous consumption rates.  Initial measurements of vegetation structure and site characteristics will be recorded. We will provide training on measurement of initial ungulate winter consumption rates to park staff in spring 2007, though actual measurement of all plots would be conducted by RMNP. We will also assess the continued utility of existing exclosures. A map of suitable willow habitat on the winter range will be produced by the NPS RM I&M Network staff. During summer 2006, the field crew will establish sample points and assess current condition of willow in areas that are currently classified as being suitable willow habitat but have a predominantly grass/forb cover. These points will become part of the monitoring of willow cover in the final plan. Any aspen stand locations that coincide with those that are currently being measured as part of ongoing NRPP study of the effects of elk herbivory on ecology of aspen will be integrated and data collection as part of the NRPP study will be conducted during fall 2006.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: TERRESTRIAL, FRESHWATER AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS, #3 - Develop indexes of ecosystem sensitivity to change and vulnerability to potential stressors, and tools to predict ecosystem responses to environmental change.In fall of 2003, the elk and vegetation management planning process was initiated and scoping of issues, formulation of preliminary alternatives, and workshops to inform and involve the public were conducted through winter 2005. Currently, the park staff are working with cooperating agencies to finalize the range of alternatives. Publication of the draft management plan and EIS is scheduled for spring 2006, with publication of the final plan and EIS in later winter/spring 2007, and a record of decision to follow in early summer 2007. The research and planning process related to this topic has been ongoing for a decade and a half. During that time, the human population, both immediately adjacent to, and within a 50 mile radius of the park has continued to grow at a rapid pace. The public will expect swift action following the publication of the record of decision.  Rocky Mountain National Park will need to hit the ground running in 2007, being fully prepared to not only implement management actions, but to monitor the effectiveness, impacts, and implications of those actions. RMNP staff has already identified several key parameters that will be monitored. These include elk population size and distribution; structure and utilization levels in willow, aspen, and upland shrub (bitterbrush, sagebrush, Pondersosa pine ecotone) areas.  The objective of this study is to design and implement a monitoring plan for the park that will help them assess the effectiveness of their management actions and adapt the management actions when and where necessary to continue achieving the management plans intended goals.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan The result of this research will be a monitoring plan which includes detailed protocols for all sampling methods and recommendations on interpretation of the data collected through this monitoring program.  Electronic maps of monitoring site locations, and elk density, distribution, and location data will be provided to the park.  Site characterization and baseline data acquired during 2006 will be entered into a database and provided to park staff for use in adding future monitoring data. Training sessions will be conducted for permanent (and any 2007 seasonal) park staff involved with the implementation of elk/vegetation monitoring protocols.The monitoring plan will be used by resource management staff to monitor and assess the effects of elk management actions on elk herbivory in key vegetation communities in RMNP.  The data gathered through this monitoring program will give park management personnel the information necessary to make adaptive management decisions.  Protocols will provide park staff with standardized instructions and data sheets for consistent collection of data from one sampling period to the next.  Maps of monitoring site locations, including UTM coordinates, will allow quick and accurate location of these sites for field personnel using a GPS.  Field training sessions will be conducted in spring 2007 to provide park staff with the opportunity to have hands-on sessions to learn the field techniques since they would ultimately be responsible for future training of park staff to continue monitoring these sites.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Bison grazing ecology at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge, Colorado\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The restoration of bison (Bison bison) to the American west is the goal of a multi-organizational effort. Recently the American Bison Society was established, which seeks to work with a broad range of partners to build the scientific and social bases to achieve ecological restoration of North American bison.  In keeping with this goal, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge (RMA), Commerce City, Colorado, reintroduced American bison (Bison bison) to the Refuge in March 2007. The reintroduction of bison to the Refuge marks the 104th birthday of the National Wildlife Refuge system in the United States.  By reintroducing bison, RMA is playing a key part in advancing the Service's national bison conservation program. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge is located on the plains of Colorado, on the northeastern edge of the Denver Metropolitan area.  The RMA lands were once part of the vast Central Plains Shortgrass Prairie ecosystem that extends east from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains from Canada south across seven states of the US.  This ecosystem is characterized by a semi-arid climate with generally short, grassy vegetation that reaches peak productivity early in the summer.  Currently, the lands of the RMA are being restored to native shortgrass prairie vegetation.  Bison were historically part of this ecosystem, and short, intense periods of grazing by bison and periodic fire maintained the structure of the plant community.  Conversion of native shortgrass prairie to cropland at the turn of the twentieth century, coupled with the extirpation of free-roaming bison, suppression of fire on the plains, and human developments have changed the landscape drastically.  Restoration of the shortgrass prairie ecosystem to the RMA, including restoration of native grazers (bison and pronghorn antelope [Antilocapra americana]) is a goal of the Comprehensive Management Plan for the RMA.The land that is now the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge was acquired by the U.S. government in 1942 and established as the Rocky Mountain Arsenal.  From 1942 through 1982 both government and private chemical production facilities were operated on the arsenal and there was resulting toxic contamination of the lands immediately around these production facilities.  However, the larger, uncontaminated buffer zone was habitat for a thriving and healthy wildlife population.  During this time, croplands were converted to grasslands using grasses from Europe and Asia.  In 1992, the Arsenal was designated as a National Wildlife Refuge and the process of cleanup and remediation of the contaminated areas was begun.  Beginning with the governments acquisition of the RMA lands in 1942, no domestic grazing occurred.  The only wild ungulate species to use the lands were white-tailed (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus).   This situation provides an uncommon opportunity on the plains of the central US.--reintroduction of a large grazer into an area of land ungrazed by domestic livestock for nearly 70 years.  The reintroduction of bison to the RMA has not only historic and biological significance, but management significance as well.  RMA managers plan to use bison grazing, along with prescribed fire, as a tool to manage and maintain this shortgrass praire ecosystem.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We intend to conduct measurements of to determine vegetative productivity, and utilization by bison and black-tailed prairie dogs within the 1,500-acre pastureto evaluate effects of herbivory on key vegetation communities. We will collect three years of data (2010-2012) to evaluate effects of bison herbivory before bison are released to the entire refuge  To measure utilization by bison and prairie dogs, we will place grazing cages in each dominant vegetation type present. These sites will be chosen to be representative of the vegetation type and spread out over the pasture. 200 grazing exclosure cages (will be placed at 80 random locations in the pasture. These small, movable grazing cages are used to protect ~1m2 areas from grazing for short periods (Bonham 1989). Annual aboveground herbaceous production and consumption will be sampled by clipping all vegetation within 0.25-m2 circular plots inside and outside the movable grazing cages. All graminoids, forbs, and sub-shrubs within the plot will be clipped and sorted into dead and live portions to measure annual peak standing crop. Vegetation will be oven dried at 55o C for at least 48 hours and then weighed. Sampling will be conducted twice during the growing season to account for cool and warm season grasses. Cages will be randomly relocated after each sampling period. We will use the difference method to determine cumulative consumption and production over the growing season (Frank and McNaughton 1992). Production is calculated by summing the significant increments of standing crop inside the grazing cage for each sampling interval. Consumption is defined as significant differences in standing crop biomass inside the cage vs. outside the cages at any given time period and these differences are summed over all sampling intervals to determine consumption over the growing season. Winter consumption is determined over a single time interval by placing the cages at the end of the growing season and then sampling before spring green-up. We will measure species composition following the historic protocols for the refuge, so results are consistent. Due to word limits in Basis+ no further methods will be described.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal: Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources, Goal #1: Provide the Scientific Foundation for the Conservation of Terrestrial Plants, Wildlife, and Habitats by developing the basic biological information that partners need to formulate adaptive management strategies.The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of bison grazing on the vegetation of the RMA bison pasture in order to assess potential conflicts with other refuge management objectives.  In particular, we are interested in potential impacts of bison herbivory on nesting grassland bird habitat including: plant species diversity, shrub habitat structure and extent, vegetative productivity, and invasion of exotic species such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) into native grasslands, particularly those recently restored to a mix of native sand prairie grasses.  Our study will attempt to determine the preferences of bison for various vegetation types and their use of recently burned areas using satellite telemetry collars and measurements of plant consumption in several key vegetation types that are associated with grassland bird species.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Assessment of Desert Bighorn Sheep Habitat Suitability in Mesa Verde National Park\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) were extirpated from Mesa Verde National Park (MEVE) in southwest Colorado by the early part of the 20th century. A herd of 14 animals was reintroduced into the southwest corner of MEVE in 1946, but surveys in the 1980s indicated that the herd was not dispersing and the population was decreasing.  By 1997, only 4 animals remained.  The nearest population is located approximately 80 miles to the north in the Dolores River Canyon, with other populations located at even greater distance on the Uncompaghre Plateau and at Colorado National Monument. Previous reintroductions were of Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis canadensis), but Mesa Verde lies in an area along the boundary between the ranges of Rocky Mountain and desert (Ovis canadensis nelsonii) bighorn subspecies and has many of the characteristics of desert bighorn habitat. The nearest populations are also desert bighorns.  From 1990-1996, a joint National Park Service (NPS)-US Geological Survey (USGS) initiative dealt with habitat assessment and restoration of bighorn sheep into 15 national park units in the Intermountain Region that appeared to need restoration (Singer and Gudorf 1999).  Mesa Verde National Park was among the parks involved in this initiative but habitat assessments identified insufficient suitable habitat in MEVE and surrounding areas to support a population. The lack of suitable habitat was attributed to large areas of dense vegetation which provided too little habitat and no ability for bighorns to move between the few suitable habitat patches that existed.  At that time, it was suggested that several large wildfires might increase the prospects for restoration of bighorn sheep in MEVE (Singer and Gudorf 1999).  The previous habitat analysis was conducted in 1994 (Johnson et al. 1995), and since that time, five major wildfires have occurred both in the park and along the adjacent park boundary.  Resources management staff at MEVE, along with partners from the Colorado Division of Wildlife, Bureau of Land Management, and the Ute Mountain Indian Tribe, are investigating the potential for introducing desert bighorns into MEVE.  However, there has not been a re-analysis of suitable bighorn habitat in MEVE since wildfires have removed large areas of densely vegetated pinyon-juniper forests.  Mesa Verde National Park requires a re-assessment of bighorn habitat suitability as the first step in determining the feasibility of reintroducing desert bighorn sheep to the Park in the near future.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We propose use of an existing, GIS-based bighorn habitat suitability model (Smith et al. 1991), already tested and improved twice by USGS (Johnson and Swift 2000; Zeigenfuss et al. 2000) to analyze current habitat suitabilty in Mesa Verde National Park.  Use of this model requires obtaining digital spatial data on vegetation, topography, barriers to bighorn movement, water sources, domestic sheep grazing, and human disturbance and then combining these data using a geographic information system  (GIS) to eliminate unsuitable habitat areas.  Horizontal visibility will need to be determined for major vegetation types based on the methods of Smith et al. 1991. Field crews will locate 10-40 sample points in each major vegetation type and by viewing a 1m2 target will determine visibility at each point.  Visibility for each vegetation type will be determined by averaging sample point observations.  This information will be incorporated into the GIS and used to further eliminate unsuitable areas of bighorn habitat.  We will use this data to determine suitable areas for lambing, summer, and winter habitat as well.\n",

      "\t\tCommunicationPlan We will produce a written USGS administrative report and digital maps of suitable habitat (including lambing, summer and winter habitat) which will be delivered to Mesa Verde National Park by early December 2010.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Analysis of elk monitoring data for elk management in Rocky Mountain National Park\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In 2006, Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) began to develop a vegetation monitoring program (Zeigenfuss et al. 2011) that would allow park managers to assess progress toward objectives of the EVMP. As part of this project, over 200 monitoring sites were established and baseline data collected from 2006-2009 in winter range aspen, willow, and upland communities. This monitoring plan required annual sampling of offtake by ungulates as well monitoring of a variety of structural and compositional metrics on a five year basis. Since the majority of the sites were established by 2008, the first five-year sampling is scheduled for summer 2013. Once this data has been collected by park staff, it will need to be analyzed in a timely manner so that managers can quickly respond and adapt management actions if progress toward vegetation management goals is not being achieved.In November 2012, a wildfire burned rapidly down from the backcountry above Fern Lake in RMNP to Moraine Park. Both wildfire and firefighting operations resulted in the burning of nearly all of Moraine Park. Twenty-one willow monitoring sites for EVMP monitoring were within the fire boundary, with 17 willow sites moderately or severely burned. Approximately half of the burned sites are within elk exclusion fences. These sites made up roughly one quarter of the willow monitoring sites on the core winter range. An additional 10 aspen sites were within the fire boundary and half of these were burned as well. This presents the problem of a reduced sample size for determining effects of elk management actions since 2008, while providing a unique opportunity to study willow recovery after fire in both grazed and ungrazed conditions. This could potentially provide park managers with information on the possibility of using fire as a management tool to reach vegetation objectives. RMNP managers are proceeding with the 5-year interval data collection but require assistance several issues related to replacement of burned sites, dealing with reduced samples sizes in the willow monitoring program, and incorporating the burned sites into future monitoring.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology USGS (L. Zeigenfuss), will conduct statistical analysis of all data collected as part of the elk-vegetation monitoring program from 2006-2013 beginning in late FY2013 (September 2013) and continuing into FY2014. The final product of this analysis will be a report detailing: 1) statistical analysis methods used to analyze data; 2) changes to sampling protocols, site locations, or major events affecting monitoring sites 2008-2013; and 3) observed results and interpretation of these results in the context of the objectives of the EVMP. The results of the analysis will be presented to park managers in December 2013. Rocky Mountain National Park will be responsible for providing clean electronic copies (MS Excel spreadsheets are preferred format) of all data collected from 2006-2013 as well electronic copies of all site photos taken in 2013, and baseline photos from any sites added since 2009. All data should be in the same format across years, should have quality assurance through methods of checking electronic data against field data, and all notes detailing circumstances that may affect data quality or consistency should be provided to the USGS. RMNP will also provide notes on any known major events (fires, floods, etc.) that have affected monitoring sites since their establishment.USGS will also consult with park biologists and resource managers to assist with creating appropriate strategies to deal with 1) reduced sample sizes due to loss of sites to the Fern Lake fire and 2) incorporating burned sites into existing monitoring program so as not to miss this opportunity to study impacts of fire and herbivory on willow recovery and growth. Park will also provide GIS data files or UTM coordinates for locations of all exclosure fences. Finally, park managers need a means to easily convert raw willow data to annual offtake estimates for each site. USGS will provide either macros that would work with existing spreadsheets or code written for Ra free software environment for statistical computing and graphics (www.r-project.org)--that will facilitate quick and easy estimation of offtake values.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives \n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan This project will result in publication of a USGS Open File Report detailing the analyses conducted and presentation and interpretation of results. In addition, either MSExcel or MSAccess macros or R code will be provided to Rocky Mountain National Park that will assist with data reduction steps necessary to conduct annual analysis of willow offtake data as well as code related to all steps of data analysis.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Prior to 2008, narratives and products were listed under 832798T.3 and 3213B7F.13.3; currently listed under 3213DN7.2.1.Years 2004-2008:Mountain ecosystems of the western U.S. provide irreplaceable goods and services such as water, wood, biodiversity, and recreational opportunities, but their potential responses to anticipated climatic changes are poorly understood.  The overarching objective of the Western Mountain Initiative (WMI) is to understand and predict the responses, emphasizing sensitivities, thresholds, resistance, and resilience, of Western mountain ecosystems to climatic variability and change. Colorado State University participates with other institutions to address four key questions: (1) How are climatic variability and change likely to affect disturbance regimes?  (2) How are changing climate and disturbance regimes likely to affect the composition, structure, and productivity of vegetation (particularly forests)?  (3) How will climatic variability and change affect hydrologic processes in the mountainous West?  (4) Which mountain resources and ecosystems are likely to be most sensitive to future climatic change, and what are possible management responses?  Specifically, the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory will ask (a) where is the productivity of mountain ecosystems sensitive to climatic variability; (b) how do climatic variability, fire, and land use affect biophysical interactions in aquatic systems and soils; and (c) which mountain resources and ecosystems are likely to be most sensitive to future climatic change, and what are possible management responses?Years 2008-2013:As mountain ice shrinks and the dynamics of seasonal snowpack change, an unexpected response appears to be altered water quality via increased heavy metal concentrations and nitrogen from newly-exposed sediments (Thies et al. 2007, Williams et al. 2007, Baron 2008, Baron et al. in review). This phenomenon has implications for high elevation aquatic ecosystems where slight increases in nutrients trigger eutrophication and where heavy metals pose a water quality risk. In the western U.S. there are many high elevation, ultra-oligotrophic water bodies as well as glacierized mineral belts with heavy metals (Fenn et al. 2003, Church et al. 2007). Based on water quality changes from melting rock glaciers in Colorado (Williams et al. 2007, Baron et al. in review), Canada (Lafrenire & Sharp 2005), and the Alps (Thies et al. 2007), we will explore this same phenomenon in Western mountains.Ecohydrology couples climate-caused changes in mountain hydrology with the responses of forest vegetation and disturbance (Breshears 2005). Changes in glaciers, snowpacks, streamflow, and water quality directly affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and changes in water relations in the coupled atmosphere-soil system affect vegetation through stress and altered disturbance regimes. Empirical studies will focus on semi-arid watersheds, in which vegetation responses are especially sensitive to drought and disturbances, and subalpine forests in Loch Vale (Central Rockies) where we build on existing long-term geochemical measurements. Modeling studies will use our existing set of case-study watersheds, addressing the full range of environmental gradients across the West.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology 1. We will combine empirical data analysis, remote sensing, and simulation modeling to develop climate-forest productivity relationships in Western mountains (Peterson & Peterson 2001, Peterson et al. 2002).  Multivariate methods will determine spatial patterns of variation in tree growth (from existing tree-ring chronologies) across the WMI region in response to climatic variability, including PDO and ENSO (McKenzie et al. 2001, Gedalof et al. 2002).  Regional-scale patterns will be validated with a 20-year record of satellite-derived net primary productivity (NPP), based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at 8-km spatial resolution (Hicke et al. 2002), to compare and contrast responses to climate across mountain regions.  Gridded temperature and precipitation data (1-km resolution) will be taken from the DAYMET model (Thornton et al. 1997).  We will then develop predictions of forest productivity and aboveground carbon storage in response to projected climatic trends estimated from downscaled GCM output.  Empirical and satellite-derived data on productivity will be compared to output from mechanistic simulations from RHESSys.  2. We use the conceptual approach provided by RHESSys to propose sensitive landscapes and processes (productivity, transpiration, soil moisture, hydrology, water chemistry) across all WMI sites to (1) identify specific locations on the landscape that will respond rapidly to climatic change (sensu Urban 2000), and (2) generalize which processes will be most response to specific changes in climate and/or disturbance regimes.  Model results augment our extensive knowledge of how Western mountain ecosystems work to build a comprehensive picture of what is likely to change, and why. 3. We will continue monitoring precipitation, discharge, phytoplankton, soil moisture and temperature, and water quality in Loch Vale watershed, Rocky Mountain National Park in 2007.   Archived phytoplankton samples will be analyzed for species composition and cell numbers by an expert phytoplankton taxonomist.  The Loch Vale web site will be maintained, with data records and publication lists kept up to date. Refer to www.nrel.colostate.edu/projects/lvws for specific methods.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal - Ecosystems - 1: Quantify and understand factors influencing patterns of temporal and spatial variability in key ecosystem components and processes.Ojectives for years 2004-2008: (1) address how/where is the productivity of mountain ecosystems sensitive to climatic variability; (2) address which mountain resources and ecosystems are likely to be most sensitive to future climatic change, and what are possible management responses; and (3) maintain long-term ecosystem and biogeochemical monitoring and research in Loch Vale Watershed in Rocky Mountain National Park.Objectives for years 2008-2013: survey a range of Western headwaters in WA, ID, MT, WY, CO selected from the 1985 EPA Western Lake Survey and Regional Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program Southern Rockies case study (http://www.epa.gov/nerlesd1/land-sci/southern_rockies) to capture bedrock spanning highly unreactive to strongly mineralized geochemistry. Late summer surveys will include major ions, heavy metals, and stable isotopes of C, N and O. Continue intensive process-based studies in the Colorado Rockies to determine the source of late summer flow and solutes using stable isotopes of C, N, and O in inorganic and organic solutes in glacierized and non-glacial catchments. Initiate water quality measurements at all benchmark glacier sites to track changes as glaciers recede.Initiate Ecohydrological in Loch Vale, a subalpine forest watershed in Central Rockies, to quantify hydrologic conditions across a gradient in soil moisture availability while combining field and chamber measurements of tree carbon gain and water loss. With researchers at Colorado State University and Los Alamos National Laboratory: (a) characterize hydrologic conditions by monitoring spatially distributed soil moisture, matric potential, soil temperature, and saturated water levels; (b) use leaf and whole-tree gas exchange, sap flow, spectroradiometry, soil moisture, plant water status, stable carbon isotopes, and LiDAR to quantify tree responses to elevated temperature and water stress; and (c) evaluate model estimates under natural and N-fertilized conditions, taking advantage of a 10-year fertilization experiment. Parameter values from these multi-scale measurements, in conjunction with RHESSys, will quantify levels of past and current water stress and hillslope hydrology and forecast the fate of subalpine forests under climate change.In the preceding phase of WMI research, we used RHESSys to model ecosystem processes and hydrology in five forested montane watersheds representing diverse conditions across the western U.S. (sites in MT, CO, NM, CA, WA). In addition, ongoing RHESSys applications as part of other projects include a range of watersheds throughout the West (Tague et al. 2008; Tague et al. in review). Analysis at the scale of these sites (<800 km2) is critical given that management of resources takes place at small watershed scales where process-based interactions are determined by gradients in snow, temperature, and radiation; spatial distribution of moisture; vegetation structure and pattern; and disturbances. This abundant RHESSys model output is ready to be carried to the next level of interpretation. Models are useful as hypothesis-generating tools, and we will use observations and analysis from Sections 1, 2, and 3.1 above to iteratively refine model estimates of coupled ecohydrologic responses, thereby maximizing the value of previous simulations while integrating new data. Models are also valuable tools for generating scenarios; we will use RHESSys to forecast ecosystem responses to climate change.\n",

      "\t\tMethodology 1.  Sedimentary charcoal, pollen, and macrofossil records of past fire activity, vegetation, and climate that extend back more than 10,000 years have been developed at multiple Western mountain sites (several funded by WMI).  Few inter-regional charcoal-record syntheses have yet occurred, and key spatial and temporal gaps in data availability remain.  We will: (a) conduct a workshop in 2005 to foster synthesis of these data for Western mountain regions, focusing on the synchrony, magnitude and abruptness of fire regime changes in response to Holocene changes in climate and vegetation, providing millennial-scale context for modern fire regimes; and (b) present some of the workshop findings at the 3rd International Fire Ecology and Management Congress in San Diego, CA Nov 13-17 2006, and (c) fill key regional gaps in montane sedimentary charcoal/pollen records in the Southwestern US, including a deep (80m) sediment core from a 500,000 year-old paleolake in the Valles Caldera in New Mexico and the varved Holocene sediments of Tiago Lake in Colorado.  2. Regional networks of crossdated annual- to seasonal-resolution fire scars from tree rings (several funded by past WMI projects) provide high-precision insights into short-term climate-fire relationships, but West-wide syntheses are needed to address such questions as: How do ENSO and PDO influences differ across Western mountains?  What generalities can be made regarding climatic events that lead to regional fire years, considering both surface and crown fires?  We will (a) conduct a workshop in 2005 to foster West-wide synthetic analysis of existing fire-scar networks, (b) present some of the workshop findings at the 3rd International Fire Ecology and Management Congress in San Diego, CA Nov 13-17, 2006, (c) conduct additional fire history research on the Valles Caldera National Preserve and Santa Fe River watershed, and (d) quantify regional-scale associations between climate and fire that will facilitate extrapolations to future climate.  3. We will: (a) use aerial photos and fieldwork to map spatial patterns of recent/ongoing conifer dieback, and use GIS to determine landscape-scale patterns of mortality;  (b) compile West-wide patterns of recent insect outbreaks (e.g., from regional USFS surveys) and seek synergistic climatic drivers, and (c) determine forest responses to interactions among land uses and extreme climatic and disturbance events, including organizing a WMI workshop in 2007 on the synergistic effects of climate, land uses, and multiple disturbances on montane forest dynamics.4.  Drought, fire, and land use  individually or in combination  can reduce vegetation cover below thresholds, triggering changes in watershed runoff and erosion processes.  We will work to identify the occurrence and persistence of these thresholds through (1) continued data collection and synthesis on watershed responses of vegetation cover, runoff, and erosion to climate variability at the long-term Frijolito study site;  (2) a synthesis of literature on fire-induced changes in runoff and erosion in the Western US, including WMI sites.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Long term monitoring and research at Bandelier National Monument\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem As a park-based USGS field station, we provided essential support to the park in the area of long-term ecological monitoring of important ecosystem variables.  We routinely provide technical assistance on a wide array of natural and cultural resource activities at Bandelier National Monument (BAND). For example, we constantly provide ecological reference materials and customized data summaries to park staff, as the USGS field station is the focal point for such information at BAND.  Since 1989 Allen has served as the primary scientific consultant to the Superintendent and the Chief of Resources Management on significant natural resource issues, and routinely represents park-related science issues in meetings with other agencies and the public.  The research conducted by this field station is integral to addressing the major resource management issues at Bandelier.We also routinely respond to many requests for technical advice and assistance from a variety of agencies in the region, including the Rocky Mountain Region of the National Park Service, individual parks in this and other regions (particularly El Malpais National Monument, Pecos National Historical Park, Mesa Verde National Park, Chaco Culture National Historical Park), other DOI Bureaus (including Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Indian Affairs), Native American communities, various U.S. Forest Service entities, State of New Mexico Environment Department, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos County, and many non-governmental organizations.  Since 2001 we have been providing scientific support to the newly established Valles Caldera National Preserve toward the establishment of an incipient natural resource inventory, monitoring, and research program.This place-focused work includes determination of ecological patterns and processes at multiple spatial scales in current and past landscapes, and the establishment and utilization of long-term, ecological monitoring networks.  The station collaborates with a variety of external scientists in portions of this work.  Major research partnerships occur with the University of New Mexico, Los Alamos National Laboratory, University of Arizona (includes UA Tree-Ring Lab), Northern Arizona University, Colorado State University, USGS Water Resources Division, and USDA Forest Service.  Particular studies include:- Long-term ecological monitoring across landscape gradients in the Jemez Mts.:  Includes multiple datasets of ~15 years duration on vegetation, tree growth, erosion, and arthropods.- Pion-juniper woodlands: ecology, runoff and erosion dynamics, ecological restoration, with intensive watershed work in BAND.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Long-term monitoring of the responses of key ecosystem parameters (herbaceous cover, runoff, erosion, tree growth) to interannual climatic variation. These activites include:  1)  > 3 km of vegetation/ground cover transects, using methods mirroring the NSF-funded Sevilleta Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program;  2) surface-dwelling arthropod collections from 108 pitfall traps at 18 sites within BAND, again mirroring the Sevilleta LTER approach; 3) annual measurements of soil erosion/aggradation from several dozen localities in BAND;  4) weekly measurements of tree growth from dendrometer bands on 38 trees;  and 5) detailed measurements of  runoff, erosion, and sediment movement in a small (1-ha.) watershed, which links to similar studies in two watersheds by LANL collaborators.  All data from these monitoring efforts are collected and maintained at the USGS Jemez Mountains Field Station through onsite, joint efforts with BAND staff.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal - Ecosystems - 1: Quantify and understand factors influencing patterns of temporal and spatial variability in key ecosystem components and processes.Continue long-term monitoring of the responses of key ecosystem parameters (herbaceous cover, runoff, erosion, tree growth) to annual climatic variation.  These components build upon each other to develop a multi-faceted perspective of climate effects on semiarid woody ecosystems in the Southwest.  Note that a key element of each component is the collection of data at multiple spatial scales and at long time scales.  In particular, the development of large, regional-scale networks of long-term ecological monitoring and global change research allows regional climatic causes of change to be discriminated from more local (often human-initiated) causes.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Ecological Effects of Nitrogen and Sulfur Deposition\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Air pollution is a multidimensional problem.  Atmospheric deposition stresses ecosystems over regional scales with inputs of acids and nutrients (e.g., sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonium, acidity).  These chemicals are transported through soil, vegetation, ground- and surface-waters, causing complex, and seemingly contradictory, responses in ecosystems.  A cascade of adverse ecological effects occur that can include fertilization-enhanced forest growth but also forest ecosystem decline, lake/stream eutrophication but also acidification, increases in plant and algal biomass but also a loss of species diversity.  Loss of soil nutrient cations and alterations of disturbance regimes are further consequences of atmospheric deposition (Driscoll et al. 2001; Fenn et al. 2003b). Atmospheric deposition of pollutants clearly alters the structure and function of sensitive ecosystems.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The methods for this project include a combination of model development and testing, surveys of lake, soil, and foliar chemistry, lake biota and stoichimetry, paleolimnological techniques, experimental fertilization studies, and long-term monitoring.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal - Ecosystems - 1: Quantify and understand factors influencing patterns of temporal and spatial variability in key ecosystem components and processes.1) develop, test and apply ecosystem hydrochemical models to simulate past, current, and future chemical and biological responses to air pollution stress in diverse ecosystems of North America; 2) survey past and current indicators of response in Western mountains; 3) develop a regional perspective of atmospheric deposition impacts; and 4) produce simple, robust indicators of ecosystem responses that reflect true process understanding and inform federal land managers, regulatory agencies, and the public.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Long-term Ecosystem Biogeochemistry\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The effects of most human stressors on natural resources are not direct cause-effect relationships, but are chronic, subtle, and synergistic.  To quantify the relative effects of such factors requires a conceptual approach that can statistically detect and separate incipient changes from human and non-human factors, quantify their magnitude, and project probable long-term consequences.  The most effective data gathering approach is use of long-term, ecosystem-level inventory, monitoring, and research.  Processes such as terrestrial biogeochemical cycling of key nutrients and energy (carbon), and change in aquatic community composition are emphasized.  The goal of this task is to gain a fundamental understanding of the structure and function of northern watershed ecosystems located in national parks and preserves.  Two of the sites are boreal with one at the southern extent of the North American boreal biome and the other at the taiga-tundra tree line.  The boreal biome is the second largest terrestrial biome, contains the greatest area (11%) as aquatic ecosystem, but is little studied relative to its importance.    Keywords: long-term, ecosystem structure and function, boreal, arctic, high-latitude, biomass, biodiversity, Colorado, Michigan, Alaska, stream, lake, watershed, precipitation chemistry, stream chemistry, lake chemistry, ecosystem production, aquatic ecosystem, terrestrial ecosystem, soil processes, nitrogen mineralization, carbon mineralization, soil respiration, nutrient budgets, energy budgets, Calumet watershed, Isle Royale, Wallace Lake watershed, Noatak National Preserve, Asik watershed  USGS funding for this task has come primarily from USGS - FORT base funds.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology All sites use the small watershed ecosystem model with a lake or significant wetland incorporated.  This model permits us to link hydrology to other ecosystem processes regulating the cycling of nutrients and energy (carbon).  The model permits direct field quantification of nutrient and energy budgets, and gives additional statistical power to detect incipient change in ecosystem processes regulating the retention of nutrients and energy.  Each site carries out some or all of the following activities: above- and below-ground physical monitoring of factors as climate, precipitation chemistry and inputs; canopy, forest floor, and soil modification of atmospheric inputs; long-term vegetation plots or sample points in lakes to detect change in productivity, biodiversity and biomass nutrient content; and the outflow (export) of nutrients and energy as measured in stream water using flumes at the mouth and intermediate points within the watershed.  To improve quality assurance, all routine inventory and monitoring procedures use common protocols for a given activity among sites.  To improve quality assurance and quality control most samples are analyzed in the same laboratory.  Long-term cooperative agreements are maintained with several universities and two other Federal agencies (US Forest Service, Ag. Research Service) to carry out the research and I&M.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Program element and goal - Ecosystems - 1: Quantify and understand factors influencing patterns of temporal and spatial variability in key ecosystem components and processes.  1) Gain a basic understanding of long-term change in  structure and function of northern (boreal, northern hardwood)protected ecosystems in national parks and preserves; 2) assess the longer-term effects of disturbance (chiefly atmospheric inputs, climate) on ecosystem processes and biodiversity; 3) link changes in ecosystem processes and components to change in biodiversity and biomass, and 4) examine long-term interactions among below- and above-ground processes and biotic functional diversity.\n",

For a summary of such products, see Products under former Project Reference Ecosystems, Task 4.    We anticipate significantly less participation in professional meeting presentations mainly due to time and funding constraints, but more emphasis on external publications.  For the latter, we will continue the emphasis on past data synthesis into monographs for all sites.  Near-future study will renew the past focus on natural abundance isotope study (see Wallace Lake and Asik publications) and soil trace gas efflux.\n",

Final synthesis of this information will markedly update the fragmented data available on these taxa, and for the first time resource managers interested in bats will have summaries available that will key them in to the potential occurrence of these species of bats in their area, their likely habitat associations and roosting requirements, and other information pertinent to management for bats.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments We have deferred completion of the project until 2010. Progress has been delayed due to responsibilities on other tasks that unexpectedly arose, primarily Task 2 (bat use of Mesa Verde National Park)when the latter NRPP study was assigned to the project leaders. Delay was also experienced due to the unexpected assumption of a project for FWS in FY08 on the assessment of sheath-tailed bats in the Pacific islands, and involvement in the federal response to white-nosed syndrome outbreak in US bats. At this point in this synthesis project the literature review is about 90% complete, and all distribution data have been validated and put in GIS format for distribution maps.

      "\t\tTaskNumber 2\n",
      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED-NRPP-IM-06-25:  Bat use of coniferous forests at Mesa Verde National Park.\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Many of Mesa Verde National Parks (MEVE) coniferous forests and woodlands offer important habitat for bats, particularly roost trees for birthing and raising young, but these forest communities do not survive wildfires and regeneration takes 2 or more centuries. High intensity fires have destroyed a large proportion of the park's pinyon-juniper, Douglas-fir, and ponderosa pine habitats in recent years. Additionally, starting in 2000 the park experienced 3 years of drought and a severe outbreak of pinyon engraver beetles, Ips confusus, which is devastating large areas of unburned pinyon trees; other conifers remain vulnerable to other bark and wood-boring pest insects. Intentional fuels reduction activities are impacting the woodlands by direct loss of trees and by promoting the further spread of tree pathogens. Without knowing it, park management practices may put some bat populations at risk, including species that are rare or past candidates for listing under the Endangered Species Act. To determine habitat use, the park has requested that USGS-BRD investigators conduct an intensive 2-year survey of the bat populations utilizing the old-growth pinyon-juniper woodlands, other coniferous stands, and rocks and crevices. The survey will include capture, identification, marking with miniaturized radio transmitters, release, and tracking. Important foraging areas, roosts, maternity sites, and hibernacula will be identified and mapped. Conservation recommendations will be provided.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology USGS BRD investigators and assistants will compile existing information on bat species at Mesa Verde. Information to be gathered will include data on species occurrence, localities of occurrence, population size of known colonies, and any related population information. Other sources of this information in addition to results of field work will include published accounts in the scientific literature, unpublished reports and databases maintained by state, federal, and non governmental agencies, and journal notes and unpublished data from universities, museums, and other institutions.Roost site locations, colony counts and composition, and roost tree and tree stand characteristics will be determined using miniaturized radio transmitters and site visits. Small numbers of bats of selected species will be captured in mist nets set in pinyon juniper forest and equipped with 0.6 gram radio transmitters. Radio tagged bats will be followed to roosts so that roost sites, roosting habitat, colony sizes, and roosting associates can be determined. Radio telemetry will be conducted for two summers. Any previously known roost sites also will be examined for occupancy. In addition to searches for bats with transmitters, ground surveys will be carried out in likely areas where possible. These areas will be searched visually for the presence of bats by using mirrored sunlight and searches for bat droppings, stains, and other bat occupancy signs. Locations of roosts will be recorded photographically and with GPS units. As an adjunct where possible, electronic bat detectors will be used to obtain data on habitat use, times of activity, and species identification for those species with distinct calls. Spotted bats, Allen's big eared bats, and the big free tailed bats can be identified by their audible echolocation calls. Notes on their occurrence will be recorded on standard data sheets.The information obtained and compiled above will be incorporated into a report summarizing findings by species and locality, with emphasis in integrating available information for the general area. A literature review will be included that updates and evaluates information on bats of this region. Conclusions also will contain specific recommendations for future research, management of forests, wildfires and fuels, and conservation.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings We sampled bats at Mesa Verde on 123 nights in 2006 and 2007. We captured 2,037 bats, documenting 15 species by capture and a 16th through vocalizations.  Mesa Verde is used by all species of bats known from western Colorado. We caught 2 species previously unknown for Mesa Verde and 1 not documented for over 40 years.      Five species had sex ratios highly skewed towards males; in 2006 most of these showed no evidence of female reproduction. Adult sex ratios of a few other species also seemed to favor males. Females were numerically dominant in the most common species, the long-legged myotis, and this species used mesa tops during reproduction.  We recorded female reproduction in 13 species. Birth and lactation occurs late June to late July.  Adult females had low reproductive rates in 2006, and seemed to favor areas lower in elevation.  A general absence of juveniles in 2006 also suggested low reproduction and that young bats were not foraging at higher elevations. Findings on sex ratios and reproduction in 2006 suggested 2 hypotheses: 1)upper canyons and mesas may be too high and cool to be favorable for reproduction by some bats; 2)conditions in 2006 were unfavorable to bat reproduction. In 2007 we increased sampling at lower elevations, and took advantage of differing conditions to compare reproduction with that in 2006. Spring (when development of young occurs)precipitation in 2007 was much higher than in 2006 (April-May totals 4.3 inches in 2006 vs 0.96 inches in 2007, and 2.3 inches mean over a 58 year period).  Increases in herbivorous vegetation and the insect community follow such increases in spring precipitation.  Indeed, preliminary compilations show more reproductive female and juv bats in 2007. We also caught more reproductive females of some species at newly netted lower elevation sites in 2007.     We obtained records of 189 specimens from Mesa Verde held at the Museum of Southwestern Biology.  We documented another 101 specimens housed elsewhere, and other records in reports and publications. Unlike our netting survey, none of the other records added to the list of species. This past work documented the presence of 13 species of bats at Mesa Verde and nearby locales.      We radiotagged 74 bats to determine roost locations.  Most bats roosted in crevices in boulders and cliff faces on the park.We determined the precise location of two maternity roosts used by spotted bats, the first known breeding colonies in Colorado. The high mesas at Mesa Verde bisected by numerous canyons and cliff faces provide very favorable roosting habitat for bats.  It is our conclusion that this feature overrides any extensive reliance on pion or juniper trees and snags as roosts by bats.      We began a reference library of echolocation calls of bats at Mesa Verde by recording vocalizations from bats released after capture on an Anabat II detector interfaced with an IBM-compatible laptop computer. We also randomly selected 2 sites in intact and 2 sites in burned pion-juniper forest on Chapin Mesa using GIS. We passively monitored bat calls at each station for 10 nights each summer month at the 4 stations.  15,389 files were collected from all stations combined.  We quantified the number of bat passes within these files and identified 12,888 to species or species groups. Activity among sites was variable due to nightly differences and had large standard deviations.  Based on statistical analysis of sample size requirements of the 2006 data we recommended that the fixed monitoring station recording be discontinued in 2007 because of insufficient available equipment and effort to adequately determine effects of past burns.  Instead we emphasized building up the species call library.  In 2007 we recorded 10 species of bats and 96 calls from hand releases of individuals captured during the faunal surveys.\n",

Based on statistical analysis of sample size requirements of the 2006 data we recommended that the fixed monitoring station recording be discontinued in 2007 because of insufficient available equipment and effort to adequately determine effects of past burns.  Instead we emphasized building up the species call library.  In 2007 we recorded 10 species of bats and 96 calls from hand releases of individuals captured during the faunal surveys.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In conservation biology, understanding the temporal and geographic population fluctuations of a species, and the causes for these changes, are critical in the development of long-term management strategies for the preservation of the species.  Information on population trends of a species through time, as well as the underlying causes for these trends, e.g., habitat loss and alteration, human persecution, emigration and immigration, are critical in assessing and prioritizing its conservation needs in the future.The white-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus) is one such raptor species that has demonstrated large population fluctuations over the last 150 years.  White-tailed kite populations in North America have undergone dramatic fluctuations since early records of the species from the mid 1800s.  Common in the early expeditions of the western U.S., by the turn of the century naturalists noted that white-tailed kites were rare and suspected that the species was close to extinction.  By the 1930s, the species was extirpated in the southeastern U.S. and was considered nearly extinct in California.  But kite numbers began to increase in the 1920-30s and by the 1940s, a trend towards recovery was apparent as increasing numbers were observed in subsequent decades. 1980).  Today, the white-tailed kite is a fairly common resident in California, with slowly increasing numbers in Texas, Florida, and Oregon, and in the middle Americas.  However, populations in some areas fluctuate considerably and have recently declined in others.Although there may be a number of underlying reasons for the rapid population changes in white-tailed kites, the main causes are believed to be impacts of land use practices and habitat changes on prey availability and habitat suitability.  Dramatic alterations in marshland and adjacent habitats used by kites have occurred since European settlement of the U.S., which may have affected the rodent prey populations this species is dependent upon.  Stendell noted the dependence of kite populations in the Sacramento River delta and adjacent marsh areas of California on the California vole (Microtus californicus).  Changes in habitat and agricultural practices, in addition to the introduction of non-native rodent species such as the House Mouse (Mus musculus) may have affected kite population trends.  Population fluctuations observed in kite numbers may reflect these changes in prey abundance and habitat availability.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology To address the project objectives, a multiple approach was initiated, using historical and current population data and habitat use, field monitoring of current kite populations, and the incorporation of new, innovative laboratory techniques to address questions of historic and current trophic relationships in this species, and population genetics to determine both the historic and current genetic relationships of populations of white-tailed kites in the U.S.  Historical information from museum collections, early exploration accounts, and anecdotal records can be used to compare past and present species distributions with changes in habitat availability and land use practices over a longer time scale than previously addressed.  We intend to collate this historic data, particularly information on kite museum specimens, while initiating intensive field monitoring programs at 3 study areas in California:  Arcata, Davis, and Santa Barbara.  Student field technicians will be monitoring local kite populations in these areas to assess population numbers and habitat use.  This information can be compared with previous studies to determine how population numbers and habitat use compare with historical data.The use of various genetics techniques has become an important tool in the determination of the relatedness and/or uniqueness of such groups.  Identification and preservation of genetically distinct subpopulations may be critical in preventing further degradation of the genetic diversity of a species.  Furthermore, tracing the genetic origins of individuals during historical population fluctuations and range expansions can give researchers a better understanding of the population dynamics of the species through time.  The recent development of a molecular biological technique called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has had a profound impact on the way that molecular biologists study nucleic acids.  This has led to an enormous increase in the efficiency with which measures of genetic variation can be obtained from vertebrates, and to the ability to gather such information from very small blood, skin, hair, or feather samples.  It has also made practical large-scale and high-resolution DNA sequence studies of the partitioning of genetic variation across an entire species range.  At a population level this translates to the generation of a high number of new alleles (haplotypes) over the (evolutionarily) short time periods often involved with intraspecific comparisons, and hence an efficient way to measure levels of gene flow between adjacent populations.  Sequence information from this genome also allows inferences to be made about the preglacial history of populations, and this may be of considerable importance in North American species.We plan to utilize tissue samples (blood and feathers) to address the population genetics of current kite populations from our 3 study areas.  Once DNA amplification is completed and microsatellite probes are developed, we intend to extract ancient DNA samples from kite museum specimens to compare current kite populations with historic kite populations, and to determine whether any changes have occurred over the last 150 years.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Status and Trends of Biological Resources - Develop and evaluate methods, protocols, experimental design, analytic tools, models, and technologies to measure biological status and trends.The objectives of this project are:1)To determine whether the dramatic historic population fluctuations observed in white-tailed kites was related to changes in their rodent prey populations;2)To determine the genetics of current and historic white-tailed kite populations to address: a) whether North American white-tailed kite populations were actually extirpated in the 1920s; b) and if so, determine where current kite populations originated from; and c) determine whether kite populations suffer a genetic bottleneck during the near extirpation in the 1920s.3)To assess current population trends and habitat use for comparison with historic occurrences of North American kite populations.White-tailed kites are a unique species for addressing some of these population questions.  This is a fairly conspicuous white raptorial bird that was nearly extirpated in the U.S., yet now is common and potentially expanding its population range.  The white-tailed kite is protected in the U.S. Migratory Birds Convention Act; in California, it is a Fully Protected Species and recommended for state Species of Concern status.  Although U.S. populations are considered stable, accurate assessment of population trends, and the causes for these trends, within large geographic areas are needed, especially where regional declines have been noted.By examining in greater detail the parameters that caused this species initial decline and its increase, we may gain a better understanding as to what parameters can be causing similar declines or increases in other avian species.\n",

Further refinement of these techniques, and increased collaboration with ongoing field studies, may increase the scope of such population analyses and reduce the time and costs of intensive field collection.  Once these techniques and costs are streamlined, other avian species in critical population decline may be analyzed in similar fashion.  A review paper highlighting the advantages of this general approach and its application to other avian species will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal; data generated from this study will be made accessible through the NBII.  Presentations, journal publications, and a final report to cooperators/partners (e.g., USGS, FWS, California Dept. of Fish and Game) will be made available for consideration of incorporating these techniques into their resource management programs.  Most importantly, support for this project will increase the research capabilities of the USGS and give field researchers an additional tool for addressing questions in population ecology and management.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle CLOSED-Development of stable isotope analyses for use in studies of the population dynamics and ecology of current and historic avian populations (For pre-FY07 work, see Project 8327999 Task 8).\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In conservation biology, understanding the temporal and geographic population fluctuations of a species is critical in the development of long-term management and conservation strategies.  Information on population trends of a species through time, and the underlying causes for these trends, is vital in assessing and prioritizing its conservation needs in the future.  However, determining the causes for these population declines is often difficult, taking many years of intensive field research and monitoring.  For some species, this time lag before conservation strategies are initiated may be costly to their preservation and survival.Modification of standard laboratory techniques for use in population ecology research can expedite the efficiency of these field studies.  Alternative research tools can complement existing field data and can represent an inexpensive method for collecting additional population information, especially for species whose current populations are not easily studied in the wild, already in critical decline, or extirpated.   However, incorporation of such laboratory techniques in population ecology studies has been limited, due in part to the perceived cost and availability of such techniques, the lack of efficient protocols over a range of taxa, and the lack of communication between field biologists and laboratory researchers regarding the applicability of these methods to population ecology and management issues.One standard geologic laboratory research tool that does have wide application to population ecology studies is stable isotope analysis.  Stable isotope analyses have already led to new insights into the diet and trophic separation of species in marine and terrestrial habitats, their geographic distributions in breeding and wintering areas, and the effects of habitat changes on migration patterns.  Stable isotope techniques have the added advantage of being able to reconstruct historical dietary patterns from museum specimens.  Incorporation of stable isotope analyses into population ecology studies can help answer the questions of what animals eat and where, and how environmental changes (both recent and historic) affect their population numbers.  Therefore, a collaborative BRD/GD effort to develop a quick, efficient method for applying stable isotope analyses to ecological field studies would greatly enhance research efficiency in the USGS and help expedite the initiation of conservation management strategies for species of concern.A species that has demonstrated large population fluctuations over the last 150 years is the white-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus).  Common during early explorations of the western US, by the turn of the century white-tailed kites were rare and close to extinction.  By the 1930s, the species was extirpated in the southeastern US and was considered nearly extinct in California.  But kite numbers began to increase in the 1920-30s and by the 1940s, a trend towards recovery was apparent as increasing numbers were observed in subsequent decades.  One cause for these dramatic population changes in white-tailed kites is believed to be impacts of land use practices and habitat alteration on prey availability and habitat.  R. Stendell noted the dependence of kite populations in the Sacramento River delta on the California vole (Microtus californicus).  These fluctuations in kite numbers may be related to the cyclicity of these microtine rodent populations and changes in their prey base with the introduction of the house mouse (Mus musculus) and other non-native prey species.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Because this pilot study is one of the first to use stable isotope analyses in diet/habitat comparisons between current and historic populations, a number of preliminary laboratory studies need to be conducted to determine the isotopic signatures both within and between each of the trophic levels of the white-tailed kite.  To accomplish this task, we will need to: 1) do preliminary isotopic analyses of fresh tissue samples from the different organisms within this food web; 2) determine the isotopic variation of these fresh tissue samples among individuals from the same geographic location; 3) compare between populations to determine if isotopic differences occur among geographic locations; and 4) compare these results from existing populations to past kite populations (using museum specimens) to determine if changes in diet or habitat use coincide with changes in population estimates over time.Whole body isotopic analyses from a number of different tissues collected from white-tailed kites, its main prey species (California Vole and House Mouse), and plant species that these prey animals feed upon will be necessary to determine the variation of isotopic deposition within the tissues of each of these organisms.  Comparative analyses between trophic levels will also be made to determine the level of isotopic bioaccumulation through the kite food chain.  Fresh tissue samples (feathers and blood)will be collected from 3-4 distinct locations (Arcata, Davis, Santa Barbara, s. California, 20-25 individuals per site).  Individual samples will be collected during nestling banding procedures at the nest, or through capture of adults or fledged young using raptor trapping methods.  Once captured, 4-5 fresh body feathers will be collected.  Blood samples (0.5 to 1.0 ml) will be collected from the brachial wing vein, transferred to a vial and frozen as soon as possible.  Upon completion of these collection procedures, the kite will be returned to the nest or released at the capture site.  Voucher prey samples from each location (5-10 individuals from each species) will be collected with snap traps.  Plant and seed samples used by these rodents will also be collected at the same locale to best estimate isotopic uptake for a given location.  We will then reconstruct the historic dietary patterns of kite populations in California over time to determine if changes in their prey base or stress-related changes in diet can be detected and correlated with the population fluctuations observed over the last 150 years.  We will use historic samples from museum specimens collected from the 1840s to the present day (estimated 400 museum specimen samples from 40+ university and museum collections).  The primary tissue collected will be 4-5 body feathers and skin, in accordance with the destructive tissue collection policies of the loaning museum.  In comparison with baseline isotope signatures, we will try to determine if any observed changes are due to changes in their prey base, dietary stress, or both.  We will ultimately combine this isotope data with GAP/GIS analyses to determine when and what habitat changes occurred, how they affected the diet of this species, and how these diet/habitat changes affected the population fluctuations witnessed in this species over the last 150 years.Samples will be analyzed for their isotopic composition of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur.  Carbon and nitrogen analyses will be done by combustion using continuous flow methods with a Carlo Erba NC2500 elemental analyzer coupled to a Micromass Optima mass spectrometer.  Sulfur analyses will be done by combustion using continuous flow methods with a Carlo Erba NC2500 elemental analyzer coupled to a Finnigan Delta Plus XL mass spectrometer.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Status and Trends of Biological Resources - Develop and evaluate methods, protocols, experimental designs, analytic tools, models,  and technologies to measure biological status and trends.The objectives of this pilot study are to develop quick and efficient methods for using stable isotope analyses in determining diet and habitat use differences among populations of white-tailed kites in the United States.  We will first analyze the isotopic signatures of existing populations of kites to determine whether trophic differentiation exists both within and between populations.  We will then utilize museum specimens to reconstruct historic isotopic signatures and try to determine if changes in diet or prey base occurred over time, and whether any changes detected can be related to changes in habitat and land use.  The final overall objective of this BRD/GD pilot study is the development of quick and efficient combined field/laboratory protocols for incorporating stable isotope analyses into diet/habitat use/geographic population ecology studies.  By USGS divisions working together to develop new research tools to aid field scientists, we hope not only to devise new and innovative methodologies for use in population ecology studies, but also to expand the scientific expertise of USGS in addressing research and resource management questions in the future.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The white-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus) has demonstrated dramatic population fluctuations over the past 150 years.  Once common in California, Texas, and the southeastern United States, by the1930s the species was considered on the verge of extinction.  But by the 1940s, a trend towards recovery was apparent.  Today, the white-tailed kite is a fairly common resident in California.  These dramatic population fluctuations may be related to changes in prey populations due to conversion of native wetlands to agriculture.  As a first step in understanding the effect of a changing prey base on kite population dynamics, we examined the potential for stable isotope analysis to determine if prey species can be isotopically differentiated and determine if prey base and habitat use could be assessed.  We compared d13C, d15N, and d34S values from kite wing flight feather and prey fur samples from four locations in California: 1) Arcata, Coastal-Coniferous Forest, 2) Davis, Mixed Urban-Wetland-Agricultural, 3) Cosumnes, Mixed Wetland-Agricultural; and 4) Santa Barbara, Coastal-Chaparral.  The range of isotope values is similar among locations for feather and prey samples.  The total range of carbon isotope values is 25.9 to 22.2 in Arcata, -25.8 to 19.6 in Davis, -27.0 to 15.0 in Cosumnes, and 28.2 to 20.6 in Santa Barbara.  The total range of nitrogen isotope values is 3.2 to 15.79 in Arcata, 2.8 to 18.8 in Davis, -4.0 to 15.9 in Cosumnes, and 2.5 to 20.0 in Santa Barbara.  Sulfur isotope values have a total range of 5.4 to 12.4 in Arcata, -1.1 to 9.5 in Davis, -2.7 to 14.0 in Cosumnes, and 8.6 to 15.6 in Santa Barbara.  Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotope values at each site reflect typical trophic enrichments due to physiological processes.  At each site, d13C values reflect the influence of a predominantly C3 or a mixed C3/C4 plant community.  Sulfur isotope values also reflect the influence of predominant marine or terrestrial sulfur sources at each site.  High variability in isotope values from wing flight feathers may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding avian diet and movement patterns and limit the usefulness of such analyses for addressing prey utilization and population dynamics.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The endangered Indiana bat occurs in 20 states and is the subject of numerous section 7 consultations and other actions, but reliable quantitative methods for defining population recovery or population responses to management actions have not been adequately developed. A structured decision analysis meeting of FWS Regions 3, 4, and 5 staff at the National Conservation Training Center in March 2005 identified an absence of modern demographic data as a major impediment to management.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology This work will involve working group meetings and development of designs and recommendations, with pilot-scale testing of some recommendations in the field.  The methods for likely approaches will be defined by the group and thus cannot be specified in advance, but may involve modifications of historical approaches to estimating bat numbers in hibernating clusters, application of site occupancy models to summer habitat, and very recent developments in individual identification techniques for capture-recapture analysis of survival of bats caught during autumn swarming.  Possibilities for the latter include PIT tagging, which has been applied to over 4,000 bats for survival analysis in FORT projects on other species, and application of individual genetic markers to fecal pellets.  Molecular aspects of the latter technique were succesfully developed for Indiana bats over the past few months at the FORT genetics laboratory in conjunction with Indiana State University, supported in part by 2005 SSP funds.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Conservation studies of long-nosed bats (Leptonycteris) in New Mexico\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Three species of nectar-feeding bats seasonally migrate from Mexico into the southwestern United States to feed from, and in turn pollinate, the flowers of cactus and Agave.  These species are the Mexican long-tongued bat (Choeronycteris mexicana), the lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris curasoae), and the greater long-nosed bat (L. nivalis).  All three species are likely at risk of population declines and both species of Leptonycteris are protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.Prior to 1992, little was known about the biology of long-nosed bats in southern New Mexico.  A few scattered occurrence records existed from previous decades and both species were known to occur in the state, but no major daytime roosts were known.  In 1992, more than 150 Leptonycteris were netted at a site in the Animas Mountains, which led to the subsequent discovery of a nearby daytime roost that is used by both species.  As of the late 1990s, this roost in the Animas Mountains was known to be used by as many as 500 bats, but regular surveys were lacking.  New Mexico is unique as it is the only state in the U.S. where both species of endangered Leptonycteris are known to occur together and the roost in the Animas Mountains was unique because it was the only major daytime roost in North America that was known to be occupied by both species.Between 2002 and 2005, the USGS Fort Collins Science Center, Arid Lands Field Station completed a detailed study into the occurrence and movement patterns of both species of endangered long-nosed bats in the mountains of southwestern New Mexico.  This work was carried out for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and involved four major components: 1) conducting capture surveys throughout the region to determine species distributions; 2) searching abandoned mines in the region for signs of use by Leptonycteris; 3) following the nighttime movements of radio-tagged bats from ground-based telemetry stations and, 4) monitoring the dates of occurrence and number of bats present at major roosts in the region.  The first two components of the project (capture and mine surveys) were completed in 2004, the radio tracking work was completed in 2005, and roost surveys were carried out through the summer of 2006.  The key findings of this work were: a lack of evidence that these species use abandoned mines in the region; the discovery of a major, yet previously unknown, roost occupied by both species on BLM land in the Big Hatchet Mountains; and conclusive evidence that both species regularly fly from daytime roosts in the Animas and Big Hatchet mountains to feed on Agave in the Animas Mountains.  Although the previous radio tracking work provided unambiguous evidence that bats roosting in the Big Hatchet Mountains often commute to the Animas Mountains (~ 30km) to forage, it was unclear whether or not they regularly utilized potential foraging areas (i.e., stands of Agave) to the north, east, and south of the Big Hatchet range.  Although radio tracking during the summers of 2003 through 2005 did not indicate major use of those areas, the results could have been biased because most of the bats tracked were initially captured in the Animas Mountains.  Thus, if long-nosed bats are more likely to return to the same foraging areas each night, the bats that were tracked may have been less likely to use areas outside of the Animas Mountains.  Do most of the long-nosed bats that roost in the Big Hatchet Mountains forage in the Animas Mountains?  The newly discovered roost in the Big Hatchet Mountains is the largest in the state (used by >7000 bats), as well as the largest colony that is known to be comprised of both species.  Because large tracts of land to the north, east, and south of the roost in the Big Hatchet Mountains support Agave and are thus potential foraging areas for long-nosed bats, addition data on bat movements from this site are needed.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology 1) attach radio transmitters to Leptonycteris captured while exiting the roost in the Big Hatchet Mountains2) track the nighttime movements of tagged bats from an aircraft circling above the Big Hatchet Mountains3) follow the nighttime movements of individual bats by aircraft to determine their foraging areas4) opportunistically make flights during the day to locate previously unknown roosts used by tagged bats\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife Resources - Evaluate the status of animal species at risk and develop scientific information and decision support tools that the Bureau of Land Management needs to effectively manage endangered wildlife resources.The primary objective of this work is to follow the nighttime movements of long-nosed bats as they disperse from a major roost on land overseen by the Bureau of Land Management in the Big Hatchet Mountains of southwestern New Mexico, with a focus on determining whether or not these nectar-feeding bats rely on century plants in areas actively managed for cattle grazing by the BLM.  The secondary objective is to locate additional daytime roost caves.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Final reports, in electronic and paper formats, were delivered to the BLM Las Cruces Field Office in August of 2006 and September of 2009.  These reports included: 1) written overviews of the tracking efforts; 2) analyses and interpretation of nighttime tracking data; and 3) detailed USGS quad maps (1:24,000-scale) showing areas used by tagged bats.  All digital and hardcopy data are housed at the USGS Fort Collins Science Center.  Data from the radio telemetry parts of this project were made available through a USGS data release: https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70189275And a paper summarizing the tracking work was published in Western North American Naturalist in September of 2017:Bogan, M.A., P.M.

Our approach will: 1) replicate previous Park-wide beaver surveys and identify possible limiting factors in each drainage; 2) evaluate the effects of the Grand Ditch (de-watering the Colorado River and its tributaries) on beaver ecology and landscape processes in the Kawuneeche Valley 3) evaluate mortality and dispersal as factors limiting beaver populations, and 4) evaluate the interaction of beaver and elk as a mechanism of declining willow.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Procedure 1.  Review existing beaver survey data relative to the Grand Ditch vs Control and Elk Winter Range vs Control treatments.  Select 4 general study areas and repeat historical beaver surveys using overlays of 1996, 1:24,000-scale, aerial photographs to map the general areas of active and recent locations of beaver dams and lodges.  Estimate beaver populations by multiplying number of active (scent mounds, tracks, scat present) beaver lodges by 6 (2 adults, 2 juveniles, and 2 sub-adults from the previous breeding season).  Select 4 specific study sites each containing approximately 5 - 10 miles of suitable reintroduction area.  We will especially search for potential habitat that is \"suitable but unoccupied.\" In addition, for selected abandoned beaver ponds, we will take core samples from beaver-scarred trees to estimate time of last activity (Neff 1955).  This data will help us understand historical beaver declines and their relation to limiting factors.Obtain new large-scale (1:2,400 color infrared) aerial photographs of the selected study drainages, approximately 50 miles total.  These photos will be used to map exact locations of dams, lodges, ponds, and willow communities which will be clearly visible at that scale.  The Bureau of Land Management in Colorado completed extensive coverage of their riparian at this scale in the early 1990's.  The proposed BRD Principal Investigator (i.e., B.W. Baker, Fort Collins, CO) successfully used these photos in his beaver restoration studies at Douglas Creek (Baker 1992, Baker 1993).  These photos will then become a permanent base to accurately monitor beaver/willow community changes during this study and beyond.Procedure 2.  Our Limiting Factors Analysis' will synthesize all relevant existing information into one document.  This synthesis will focus on the interactions among beaver, disease (e.g. tularemia), water availability, willow/aspen ecology, distribution and abundance, regional climate changes, and ungulate herbivory of shrubs in winter and herbaceous riparian vegetation (i.e., summer beaver food).  We will use the Beaver Habitat Suitability Index model (Allen 1983) and Retzer et al. (1956) as guides. We will especially focus the investigation on comparing abandoned and occupied habitat and developing criteria to identify suitable but unoccupied' habitat to be used to meet objectives 4 - 6.Procedure 3. To evaluate beaver mortality and dispersal we will live trap, attach radio transmitters, and track beaver on the east side of the Park. To better understand how tularemia, or other diseases, influence beaver populations at ROMO, we will sample blood from all live-trapped beaver and any beaver found dead.Procedure 4. To evaluate the effects of the Grand Ditch on beaver ecology in the Kawuneeche Valley we will develop Digital Terrain and Hydrologic Models to better understand beaver landscape features, surface flows, ground water, biogeochemisty, and nutrient dynamics.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources-Provide the Scientific Foundation for the Conservation of Terrestrial Plants, Wildlife, and Habitats by developing the basic biological information that partners need to formulate adaptive management strategies. The task goals are to understand the factors limiting beaver populations in Rocky Mountain National Park and how de-watering by the Grand Ditch has altered beaver ecology in the Kawuneeche Valley. The objectives are to (1) quantify the influence of beavers on valley bottom water tables, (2) quantify the influence of beavers on sediment deposition in the stream channel and floodplain, (3) determine which landforms owe their origin to beaver activities, (4) determine the relationship of landscape features to surface elevation to better understand how beaver activity has affected the distribution of surface water, (5) determine how the Grand Ditch has altered beaver influence of the valley hydrologic regime, (6) map and age beaver created landforms, (7) map riparian communities associated with all beaver controlled landforms, (8) develop a vegetation succession model using ages of beaver landforms, hydrologic and sediment analyses, and (9) develop a model of role of beavers in landscape formation, and valley hydrologic regime and vegetation patterns.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Research results will be communicated via written annual reports, a final report, scientific papers, oral presentations to Park staff and at scientific meetings, a field seminar to the Rocky Mountain Nature Association, and to the popular press via interviews for newspaper articles.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings We found beaver are important to wetland ecosystem processes in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP), Colorado. Beaver dams in RMNP can raise the water table, trap sediment, place water and sediment where floods cant reach, and create heterogeneous wetlands. Beaver populations in RNMP have severely declined since the 1940s, but blood tests of 39 livetrapped beaver found no active disease presence. Recent beaver populations occur in areas with low elk use, and beaver select relatively unbrowsed stems for winter food caches. Intense elk browsing produces willows of low vigor that are small, short, and hedged with a high percentage of dead stems. If beaver cut tall willows, and intense elk browsing suppresses regrowth, then the interaction of beaver and elk can create hedged willows that are unsuitable to beaver. Ecological modeling showed competition for willow favors elk over beaver, but beaver can increase willow productivity if elk are absent. These findings suggest beaver evolved in the absence of intense competition with other herbivores and supports a predator-driven trophic cascade hypothesis.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments During August-October 1999, we replicated former beaver surveys of past and present suitable habitat at RMNP to document current beaver activity (dams, lodges, food caches, fresh cuttings). We found that beaver declines were coincident with increasing elk populations and were most dramatic in Moraine Park ; beaver populations there were estimated at 315 in 1942, 92 in 1964, 24 in 1981, and <10 in our 1999 survey. Plans to reintroduce beaver and complete associated research in Moraine Park will be delayed to coincide with the planned vegetation management EIS at the Park.During August-November 2000, we evaluated the interaction of beaver and elk as a mechanism of declining willow and found that elk browsing severely suppressed the regrowth of simulated beaver-cut willow. During August 2001 to April 2002, we initiated a radiotelemetry study to evaluate dispersal, mortality, and life history of beaver. Blood samples from 39 beaver livetrapped all tested negative for tularemia and plague, ruling out disease as a factor preventing recovery of populations. Radiotracking beaver to determine movements and dispersal is still in progress. In May 2002 we began field work in the Kawunechee Valley to understand how beaver affect landscape processes and how de-watering by the Grand Ditch has altered beaver-related processes. In addition, we continued radio-tracking beaver to identify dispersal and mortality.In 2003 we 1 quantified the hydrologic regime, rates of sediment deposition via the sediment disck method, beaver landform and vegetation patch ages, and vegetation composition of stands in the Kawunechee Valley, 2)completed field work for the beaver radiotelemetry study that was initiated in 2001, and 3)submitted manuscripts to report the results of the beaver and elk interaction study and a new genetic method of gender identification for beaver.In 2004 we 1) quantified the hydrologic regime, the amount of sediment deposited by the Lower Beaver Dam, and vegetation established on sediment deposited by the Lower Beaver Dam, and mapped the area inundated by the Upper Beaver Dam, and 2) sumitted manuscripts on the resilience of willow after release from elk browsing and results of the beaver transmitter attachment method and published papers on factors limiting beaver populations and beaver effects on hydrologic processes.In 2005 we 1)held a field tour in Rocky Mountain NP (RMNP)that presented research results of beaver ecology and hydrology studies to Natural Resources staff, 2) presented and published (in the Proceedings) two papers on beaver research findings in RMNP to the annual meeting of the Colorado Riparian Association, 2) submitted a paper on the efficacy of transmitters used on beaver in RMNP, 3)submitted a paper on resilence of willow stems in RMNP, 4) completed the Final NRPP Report for Task 3, Declining beaver populations in RMNP, 5)completed final fieldwork for the study of beaver effects on hydrology, sediment, and plant establishment in the Colorado River valley, and 6) completed a draft manuscript that compared the effects of beaver versus floods in the Colorado River, which showed beaver dams in the main channel lifted water to the level of the upper terrace and flooded a much larger area than a high spring flow without beaver dams.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle USGS/BLM: Status and breeding ecology of Arizona grasshopper sparrow\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The Arizona Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum ammolegus) is a disjunct race that breeds in desert grasslands of southeastern Arizona, extreme southwestern New Mexico, northern Sonora, Mexico, and probably the very northwestern corner of Chihuahua, Mexico.  This subspecies, hereafter referred to as ammolegus, was only recently documented as breeding in the Animas Valley of New Mexico (Williams 1991).  It is a species of conservation concern, being listed as a high priority species for desert grassland habitats in the Partners in Flight (PIF) Bird Conservation Plans for both Arizona and New Mexico.  The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) contracted two reports on the status of this subspecies in the last 20 years (Mills 1982; Strong 1988), but it has not been updated with new, or more detailed information, for 15 years.  The USFWS list of Birds of Conservation Concern includes Grasshopper Sparrow on the list for the Sierra Madre Occidental Bird Conservation Region (BCR #34), which includes the desert grasslands of southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico.  Concerns regarding this subspecies focus on the apparent extreme fluctuations in a relatively small breeding population (Strong 1988; Williams 1997), the effects of habitat loss due to suburban development, and limited information about its breeding ecology and the effects of habitat modification due to management practices such as fire and intensive grazing.  This information is of interest to land managers of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and any other federal, state, or private managers of southwestern desert grasslands.  The following research needs have been identified in the PIF Bird Conservation Plans for Arizona and New Mexico: (1) determine the causes of decline in Grasshopper Sparrows in the Animas and Playas Valleys and survey for more populations in the boot heel of New Mexico; (2) determine the home range and breeding territory size of the Arizona race of the Grasshopper Sparrow (Arizona); and (3) determine if the Arizona Grasshopper Sparrow is a source or sink population (Arizona).This task will provide valuable information to managers of desert grasslands (BLM, USFS, FWS, etc.) regarding a grassland species of management concern.  In light of its location in New Mexico and Arizona, it presents opportunities to facilitate cooperation between the Central and Western Regions of USGS as well as to address the sorts of regional needs emphasized by the Southwest Strategy.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Roadside surveys  Historic road survey methods will be recreated to enable comparisons between historic and current data.  The same road segments will be surveyed, making the same number of stops.  Road segments will be surveyed three times, varying time of morning to address potential temporal variation in singing intensities.  The maximum number of singing males recorded for a segment will be used for abundance and/or density estimates.  We will consider the use of taped song playback to supplement the surveys. These surveys will target Grasshopper Sparrows, but will also report on additional priority grassland birds.  The following methodologies that may be used should additional funding be received.  As possible, these methods will be tested during the initial year of the project to determine their effectiveness and usefulness for this project.Alternate survey methods  Pilot testing will be done of more advanced survey methods in the first year.  These methods include double-observer, double sampling, removal method, and distance sampling.  Appropriate methods will be applied to future data collection.Location/monitoring of nests  A combination of methods will be used to locate nests.  Rope-dragging involves the dragging of a heavy rope, sometimes with cans attached, across study sites.  As the rope passes over ground nests, the incubating or brooding bird will flush up.  Observers along the rope line target nest searches around the area in which the bird flushed.  Behavioral observation methods involve the development  of search images for preferred nest sites and behavior of nesting birds. When a nest has been located, it will be marked discretely to allow it to be relocated and monitored.  It will be monitored every 2-4 days using the recommended techniques for minimizing disturbance and lowering probability of predation or parasitism.Territory Mapping   The spot mapping method involves repeated visits to sites where systematic surveys result in mapping of the identity, location, and associated behaviors of all target individuals.   A slight variation called flush mapping has been applied to studies of grassland birds.  A singing individual is approached until it flushes, whereupon its initial position, line of flight, and landing position are recorded on a field map.  The procedure is repeated until a minimum of 20 consecutive flush points are plotted on the map.  All marked positions on the map are then evaluated to identify clusters of observations and draw polygons around the observations determined to represent a single, territorial individual.  Vegetation Measurements  Standard methods will be used to document vegetation structure (grass height, biomass, vertical structure, shrub density, canopy cover) and composition (species frequency and dominance) on Grasshopper Sparrow territories.  Targeted mist netting/banding  Once a territory is identified, a mist net will be erected in the center of the territory and taped song playback will be used to lure the bird(s) into the mist net.  Upon capture, the bird will be removed from the net, measured, and fitted with a USGS aluminum band, and color bands. The bird will be released at the point\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The report to Arizona Game and Fish Department and Arizona State Parks on the Arizona Grasshopper Sparrow surveys funded and conducted in 2004 and 2005 respectively, have been finalized, approved, and sent to the appropriate funding agency and other landowners involved in the project.  Consistent with historical reports, remaining concentrations of Arizona Grasshopper Sparrows are still centered in the Sonoita, San Rafael, and Animas valleys of Arizona and New Mexico.  Compared with historical surveys, the overall pattern shows Arizona Grasshopper Sparrow populations increasing between 1982 and 1987 (Strong 1988), and, based on the surveys in this project, subsequent population declines from 1987 to 2004, although in most cases not as low as numbers in 1982.  The report expresses caution about interpreting these data, since there are not continuous, yearly data and therefore it is difficult to conclude whether the pattern described above represents continuous declines since 1987 or two points along a fluctuating plot.The results of both years surveys were published in Studies in Avian Biology, Volume 37 (2008)(see products).As the breeding ecology study field data are still being analyzed, as of August 2015, there are no key findings available.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED-The Biogeography of Marbled Godwit (Limosa fedoa) Populations in North America\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Many migratory shorebird species have experienced population declines over the past decades.  Habitat alteration, pollution, and climate change may all be contributing factors on continental and global scales. Such impacts may simultaneously affect different portions of the network of habitats important to a migratory species.  However, we cannot properly design monitoring programs to detect these impacts, much less take appropriate conservation actions until we have a clear understanding of the biogeography of these bird populations, specifically: 1) the extent to which species populations are geographically subdivided; and 2) the location of specific wintering, breeding, and migratory stopover areas used by each sub-population.The U.S. and Canadian Shorebird Conservation Plans have identified one such species, the Marbled Godwit, as a Species of High Concern.  Reasons for concern include: observed declines in breeding densities since 1966 associated with drainage of wetlands and conversion of the landscape to agriculture, and anthropogenic threats (e.g., shrimp farming, salt evaporation ponds) to wintering habitats in Mexico.  There are many knowledge gaps in our understanding of the Marbled Godwit life cycle, however.  In particular, there are few data on the linkages between specific breeding areas and wintering grounds for the three breeding populations (Gratto-Trevor 2000, Melcher et al. 2006).The need to identify wintering grounds for the three separate breeding populations has been consistently identified as the top priority.   At meetings in Sinaloa, Mexico (January 2002 ), Bismarck, North Dakota (August 2002), and Minneapolis (August 2005) partners from the USGS, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) (Prairie Pothole Joint Venture), University of Montana, Canadian Wildlife Service, and Mexico (PRONATURA) established a formal Marbled Godwit Work Group.   This Work Group, which aims to coordinate research and conservation efforts across the species range, has identified the top priority to be defining the linkages between seasonal habitats for the three sub-populations.  This priority was further emphasized in a recently published Conservation Plan for the Marble Godwit (Melcher et al. 2006), as well as during a Marbled Godwit Symposium at the recently held Shorebird Sciences in The Western Hemisphere meeting in Boulder, Colorado, 27 February  2 March 2006.   The collaborative efforts and publications mentioned above have consistently identified another high priority need - additional research in the migration corridor.  Relatively little is know about Marbled Godwits during migration, especially the key stopover sites used during both spring and fall migration.   Detailed work is needed at key stopover areas to determine parameters related to the stopover habitat quality including a) length of stay, b) body condition (i.e., fat stores), c) rate of fat gain, and d) relationships between stopover quality, annual survival and reproduction.  The Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge is perhaps the best location to start such studies because it is one of the most important (if not the most important) migration stopover sites for Marbled Godwits in terms of bird numbers, and hosts up to 40,000 individuals (or about 25% of the total estimated population) during both spring and fall migration (Melcher et al. 2006).\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Methodology:1)  We will apply 9.5 gm solar satellite PPTs (transmitters) to 10 female Marbled Godwits from each of the three breeding populations.  These state-of-the art transmitters from Microwave Telemetry in Columbia, MD are the lightest currently available.  This transmitter design, first made available in 2004, has been used successfully on Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) (a similar sized shorebird species) in Europe for more than one year (http://www.whimbrel.info/).  Based on the experience with Whimbrels, and with solar transmitters used on other animals, we are optimistic that we will get a service life of more than one year (3 yrs is possible), thus offering the potential to define breeding grounds, wintering grounds, and migration routes for at least one complete annual cycle.  Leg-loop harnesses that hold the transmitter on the lower back using elastic loops passed around both legs prevent entanglement problems experienced with other harness designs.   2)  The solar satellite radios will transmit on a 10hrs on, 24hrs off duty cycle.  Hence, we will get an estimated location on average about every two days.  Each of the data points acquired by satellite has an estimated accuracy, varying from the best of 150 m to points with an estimation error of more than 1000 m.  The data points will be imported into a GIS (ARC), overlaid with habitat information at local and regional scales (e.g., from Google Earth) to produce maps showing local movements and habitat use patterns during breeding and wintering seasons.  3)  To supplement the length-of-stay data obtained by satellite transmitter, we will also apply 4-gm VHF radio transmitters to an additional 20 individual godwits (10 in the spring and 10 in the fall) to obtain more accurate estimates of length-of-stay of Marbled Godwits at the Great Salt Lake.  We will estimate length-of-stay using field techniques and survey sampling methods (Cox 1969, Otis et al. 1993). 4) From each captured godwit (10 from each of three breeding areas, and 20 individuals from the Bear River refuge), we will clip off two secondary coverts (secondary covert 9 or 10 from each wing).  Secondary coverts will be selected because these feathers carry the chemical signature of the wintering grounds, two such feathers have sufficient mass to allow an analysis of the full suite of stable isotopes listed below, and their loss will have no significant effect on the birds well-being or ability to fly.  These feathers will be provided to the U.S. Geological Survey, Stable Isotope laboratory in Denver, Colorado for analysis of a suite of stable isotopes including C13, N15, D, O18, and S34.  These isotope data will begin to contribute to the highest need identified by the Tri-National Initiative, which is to begin collecting data that will help link specific wintering grounds in the U.S. and Mexico, with specific breeding and migration areas in the U.S., and Canada (see Hobson 1998, Farmer et al. 2004).5) For all birds captured, we will conduct two procedures.  First, we will measure selected morphometrics (weight, wing length, culmen, and tarsus) before releasing the bird.  These measurements will be used to estimate body fat with a regression equation developed by the University of Montana and the U.S. Geological SurveySecond, each captured bird will be banded on the right tarsus with a USFWS numbered, metal band for later identification if they are recaptured elsewhere.  Moreover each bird will receive a colored alpha/numeric coded darvic band on the left tibia for remote identification, using a band design and banding protocols developed by the American Oystercatcher Working Group.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources-Provide the Scientific Foundation for the Conservation of Terrestrial Plants, Wildlife, and Habitats by developing the basic biological information that partners need to formulate adaptive management strategies. Objectives:1)   Identify the migration pathways, breeding and wintering sites for selected godwits from the three breeding populations: Mid-continent of NA, James/Hudson Bay, Canada, and the Alaska Peninsula. 2)Characterize the weekly movements of godwits and estimate the length-of-stay of radio-tagged godwits at their respective winter, breeding sites.  3)Estimate the length-of-stay of selected godwits during spring and fall migration at Bear River.4)Characterize the stable isotope signature of birds captured at respective breeding, wintering and migration stopover sites.  5)Estimate the body fat of Marbled Godwits captured at respective breeding, wintering and migration stopover sites.  Locations:  Satellite radio tagging will be conducted at sites within the known breeding and wintering areas for the three disjunct populations, including 1) the mid-continent population, which migrates through Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge; 2) the James Bay and Hudson Bay, Canada (eastern Canadian population) in cooperation with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; 3) the Alaska peninsula population in cooperation with the Alaska Science Center, and 4) Nayarit/Sinaloa, Mexico (mid-continent population) in cooperation with PRONATURA and SEMARNAT.  The migration stopover work will be initiated at the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge, Brigham City, Utah.  The Refuge, located in the northeast arm of the Great Salt Lake (GSL), encompasses about 74,000 acres.  Bear River Refuge is the largest freshwater component of the GSL ecosystem and annually hosts large populations of Pacific and Central Flyway waterfowl and shorebirds and it provides the only major staging area for Marbled Godwits in the interior of North America (Shuford et al. 2002).  In addition, the Refuge, in conjunction with other portions of the GSL, is designated as a Hemispheric site as part of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Study results will be communicated to the scientific community and the general public through presentations at scientific meetings, workshops, peer-reviewed papers and press releases.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Previous Work at this Location:   This task is an extension of a previous study and associated research conducted at Bear River (Basis project 8327999, Task 21:  Determining live capture methods/techniques for migrating and staging Marbled Godwits).  In the earlier study we evaluated several different live capture methods, including 1) night capture by spotlighting and hand-netting (Cummins and Hewitt 1964), 2) mist-netting (Keyes and Grue 1982; Ralph 1976), 3) walk-in traps (Schroeder and Braun 1991), 4) noose mats (Mehl et al. 2003; McGowan and Simons 2004), and 5) shoulder-fired cannon nets (Dill 1969).  The most effective technique for capturing godwits was the use of mist nets, and hence we will capture birds in the present study using this method.In the spring of 2006 we successfully attached 12 gm satellite transmitters to two godwits using wing-loop attachments , these birds migrated to their breeding grounds in Canada and we are still eceiving locations asa of July 2006.  Hence, we believe we have worked out the techniques for radio attachment.  The current study will be expanded to include placing more satellite transmitters on Great Salt Lake godwits in the fall of 2006 and spring of 2007, and placing transmitters on godwits from the other two breedng populations (if funding is secured to do so).\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Wintering habitat use by priority grassland birds.\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem As a group, endemic grassland birds have shown steeper, more consistent, and more widespread declines than any other behavioral or ecological guild of North American species (Knopf 1994).  Understanding habitat relationships is essential for conservation of such avian species of concern; knowledge of the range of habitats that a species can use may facilitate achievement of management goals.   Research identifying vegetative structure and composition associated with select breeding grassland birds is limited, and virtually nothing is known about grassland structure and composition as used by wintering populations.  In the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, where many of these grassland birds winter, major resource management issues potentially affecting their status are the effect of grazing regimes and fire on bird habitat.    Three client bureaus -- Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land Management --  have described information needs related to grassland birds. These priority needs emphasized both the wide range of information needed to conserve grassland birds and the limited information currently available, particularly for the wintering grounds.  The FWS list of Birds of Conservation Concern lists the following grassland species for Region 2 - Sprague's Pipit, Cassin's Sparrow, Baird's Sparrow, and Chestnut-collared Longspur - and adds Grasshopper Sparrow to the list for BCR 34 (Sierra Madre Occidental) which encompasses the desert grasslands in se AZ and sw NM.  In addition, the PIF North American Landbird Conservation Plan includes the following on its 100 Watchlist species - Sprague's Pipit, and Baird's Sparrow.  An additional opportunity to address the above issues was presented on 29 April 2002, when the Ryan wildfire swept through 38,000 acres of foothills and grasslands at the southern end of the Sonoita Valley, including over 90% of the Audubon Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch.  This offered a valuable and unexpected opportunity to conduct some post-fire research to determine the effects of such a substantial fire on the wintering grassland birds of the area.  There is a lack of information about the impacts of fire on bird communities in grassland ecosystems, especially those birds that use these habitats in the winter.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Field work was conducted from approximately January 1 to March 15 beginning in January 1999 and continued through March 2001 and then again from 2003 to 2005.Many wintering grassland birds are difficult to identify --they are often cryptically colored, do not sing distinctive songs, and are reluctant to flush. Because of these difficulties, survey methods were carefully designed to achieve the most accurate identification and habitat associations possible, and field work was preceded by intensive training for field personnel. Two approaches to bird surveys were employed to address the special needs associated with surveying wintering grassland birds.   An adaptation of the standard transect, in which several people flush birds along a strip transect, was employed, incorporating distance sampling techniques.  This method is designed to address species that are more readily identified upon flushing and not readily captured in nets (e.g., Sprague's Pipit, Chestnut-collared Longspur, Horned Lark).  A second method, flushing and mist-netting, was the only means of accurately identifying certain species (Baird's and Grasshopper Sparrows) and relating their presence to habitat characteristics.  This method involved setting up a 100 m stretch of mist nets and employing 15-20 people to flush birds from a standardized area on each side of the nets.  Netted birds were identified to species.    Standard vegetation composition and structure measures, adapted from the Breeding Biology Research and monitoring Database (BBIRD) grassland vegetation protocols and protocols used by the Colorado Bird Observatory for wintering grassland bird studies in northern Mexico, were used to characterize flushing plots and transects.  Structural measures included vegetation height, vertical structure, horizontal structure, point-centered quarter measures (for density of shrubs, cactus, and trees), and visual estimates of percent ground cover and shrub canopy.   Grass, shrubs, and trees were sampled and identified to genus.     Both grazed and ungrazed sites were selected.   Plots and/or transects were randomly located within the sites.  Six plots were identified within each site for the mist-netting protocol, and 6 transects within each site for the transect surveys. The same methodologies described above were used for the post-fire component of this task, applied to one burned site (Audubon Research Ranch) and one unburned site (Davis Pasture - BLM Las Cienegas NCA) from the previous winter work.  All transects and mist net plots had been GPSed and were relocated.  The bird survey and vegetation measurement protocols were reproduced for three years post-fire so that all data were comparable.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources - Evaluate the status of plant and animal species at risk and provide scientific guidance for their conservation and management.  The objectives of this project are to address the following habitat use questions regarding a suite of high priority grassland birds, including Baird's Sparrow, Grasshopper Sparrow, Sprague's Pipit, Chestnut-collared Longspur, and Cassins Sparrow:  (1) How do these grassland birds use habitats (vegetative structure and composition) during the winter season?  (2) How is winter habitat use affected by land use practices such as grazing? and (3) How does wintering grassland birds respond to wildfire and its effects on grassland habitat?\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Both resource managers and researchers will be able to use the information produced by this project.  Technical products will be published in peer-reviewed scientific literature, management-oriented technical media, and presented at scientific and management-oriented meetings.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings From Southwestern Naturalist 2014 article:We measured structure and composition of vegetation, assessing vegetative differences among sites, and modeled associations between indices of avian abundance and six vegetative variables using generalized linear models.  For all vegetative variables, there were significant differences among sites.  Numbers of northern harriers were positively associated with total number of sparrows.  Indices of abundance for individual species of birds were statistically correlated with various measures of structure and composition of vegetation.  In particular, grasshopper and vesper sparrows were negatively associated with amount of bare ground; horned larks were negatively associated with vertical grass density; Bairds sparrows were negatively associated with shrub density; meadowlarks were positively associated with native grass.  Our results suggest that these species would benefit from management of habitat that affects the vegetative characteristics associated with their abundance.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments Phase 1 (pre-fire) - Three years of data collection were completed as of March 2001.  A presentation based on preliminary analyses of the first two years of data was given at the Cooper Ornithological Society meetings in Albuquerque, NM in April 2001.  Another presentation was given in September 2002 at the North American Ornithological Conference in New Orleans, LA entitled \"Response of wintering grassland birds to vegetation structure and composition\". A presentation was given at the American Ornithologists' Union annual meeting in August 2007. Unfortunately a manuscript submitted to The Condor in 2007 was rejected, requiring re-evaluation. The data were re-analyzed and the ms rewritten in response to reviewer comments, submitted to Condor again, and rejected again.  This ms was published in The Southwestern Naturalist in 2014 issue actually released in March 2015.Phase II (Post-fire) - All three years of data collection were completed as of March 30, 2005. The P.I. gave a presentation entitled \"Wintering Grassland Birds: studying the effects of fire and vegetative structure\" to Friends of the Audubon Research Ranch in Elgin, AZ in March 2004. Analyses in preparation for drafting of manuscripts can now proceed as results of Phase I have been published.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Closed-Boreal Toad and Wood Frog Demographics\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Studies of habitat use by the boreal toad (endangered in the State of Colorado, recently removed from the warranted but precluded federal endangered species list)in the southern Rocky Mountains are limited to an unpublished dissertation (Campbell JB. 1970. Univ. Colo) and a study in disturbed habitat (Jones, CDOW, unpublished). Little quantitative data are available about their use of habitat, of their preferences, or of the extent of their use of upland willow and dry conifer forest. The two populations in the North Fork of the Big Thompson River, Rocky Mountain National Park, provide a convenient outdoor laboratory to address these questions and reach our objectives. Without an intensive, multi-year study, population and movement data are slow to accumulate with any degree of reliability.  Additionally, projected expansion of existing developments on National Forest Land are currently threatening boreal toad habitat and potential breeding grounds. The ecological questions of movement and habitat use are of primary importance in developing management plans for the toad and in implementing its recovery in the State. This project is timely and addresses management needs expressed by a variety of agencies. At the inception of the project, Herpetofauna Status and Surveys was a FY 98 BIN priority no. 11 for NPS in the Central Region, the Fate and Effects of High Mountain Amphibians was a priority no. 9 for the FWS and Status and Trends of Species at Risk and Implications of Species Declines was a FY 98 BIN priority no. 5 for the Western Region, Amphibians continue to be of mounting concern at the State, National and International levels. Wood frogs are a species recently delisted from the State threatened list, and are, one of the 4 remaining amphibian species in Rocky Mountain National Park. We are examining the dynamics of a population (metapopulation) of wood frogs in the Kawuneeche Valley of RMNP. Our goals are to elucidate the flow of individuals among wetlands, habitat use at the small and landscape scales using capture - recapture methods and radio telemetry.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology During the breeding season, we survey and capture boreal toads at 1 to 3 breeding sites in Rocky Mountain National Park and 1 breeding site in the Bridger Teton National Forest, WY. These data will be analyzed using program MARK and build on a 10+ year data set which is providing information about population dynamics including temporary immigration and survival. Captured animals will be tested for chytrid fungus using molecular methods (PCR) as funds are available. Water samples are collected in collaboration with Water Resources Discipline and the Amphibian Research and Monitoring Program (ARMI) programWe conduct visual encounter surveys in the Kawuneeche Valley for wood frogs, chorus frogs and tiger salamanders. These efforts will allow us to compare current data to previous data on wood frog distribution in this area (Muths unpublished data1998, 2001, Haynes and Aird 1981) and to begin to develop a better understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors that affect spatial distribution and population dynamics in wood frog and chorus frog populations. This work is part of a PhD project also funded by ARMI (see that task). Survey areas were chosen non-randomly. Ponds surveyed previously were re-visited and a number of ponds identified from National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) maps and topographic maps were also surveyed. Ponds that were encountered enroute to ponds selected for survey were mapped using a GPS unit for future survey or were surveyed. Visual and aural identification were used to determine if a species was present or not detected for each visit. Data collected during surveys mirrors the data collected for the ARMI and NPS I & M surveys conducted in ROMO.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources - Evaluate the status of plant and animal species at risk and provide scientific guidance for their conservation and management.Two questions have been raised and discussed by the Boreal Toad Recovery Team, NPS biologists, ski corporation executives, and Colorado Division of Wildlife personnel these questions frame our objectives: 1. How far do boreal toads disperse from their natal pond and how much movement by adults occurs between apparently insular populations?  Are these populations components of a larger metapopulation with significant genetic exchange or are they truly insular populations without the interchange of individuals? The boreal toad is capable of moving over 5 km between breeding sites (Corn and Muths, unpub.), covering a wide range of potentially inhospitable habitats and suggesting that an entire drainage could be considered a single metapopulation (Hanski IA, Gilpin ME. 1997. Metapopulation Biology. Academic Press.). 2. What kind of habitat do adult toads use? They have been captured in a variety of habitats; from willow karrs within 20 m of breeding ponds to rocky trails over 2.5 km from established breeding ponds. We do not know what kind of habitat is critical to adult survival.The wood frog project is designed to estimate various population parameters such as survival using capture - recapture methods. We have piloted a successful radio belt design that will be used for additional radio telemetry to examine use of habitat and habitat requirements for wood frogs. This information will be used by the park in planning and in quantifying potential visitor use impacts on habitat.Information gathered from these projects will assist in the evaluation of the status of animal species at risk and provide scienitific guidance for conservation and management of such species.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Information gained from this project will be immediately useful to the Boreal Toad Recovery Team and the NPS and will be made available in a timely manner through a technical report and on the Internet through the Fort Collins Science Center's home page The potential for information transfer from the results of this project are substantial and immediate, results will be particularly useful to agencies charged with managing federal lands on which the boreal toad or wood frog occurs (U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service), and those charged with managing populations of amphibians, especially declining populations (Colorado Division of Wildlife, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, and Bureau of Land Management). The Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force, IUCN will also use the information on a global scale. The data gathered in this project will build on existing long-term data on boreal toad populations in the North Fork drainage and are directly applicable to boreal toads in the rest of the State of Colorado. The long-term nature of the wood frog study will provide similar information on a species that is apparently holding its own in RMNP when other amphibians are not.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Causes and consequences of bat fatalities at wind turbines\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Wind energy is one of the fastest growing energy sectors in the world, but the effects of this new source of power on certain types of wildlife are just coming to light. The industrial-scale wind turbines being deployed across North America and Europe are causing large numbers of bat fatalities.  Whereas bird collisions with wind turbines are sporadic and mostly seem to be random in nature, proportionally more individual bats of fewer species are found dead at wind energy facilities compared to birds--there is growing evidence that certain species of bats are actually attracted to turbines.  At several new wind energy facilities in North America, hundreds to thousands of bat fatalities have been recovered over periods lasting just a few weeks.  Species of migratory, tree-roosting bats are disproportionately represented among these fatalities and it is unknown how long their populations can withstand such impacts.  Based on available information, it has been estimated that turbines may be causing the deaths of tens to hundreds of thousands of bats per year in North America.  Unlike migratory passerine birds, bats are not known to regularly collide with other anthropogenic structures, bats have much slower rates of population growth, and there are no other factors of mortality known to affect bats migratory tree bats to such a high degree.  The emerging problem of bat fatalities at wind turbines was completely unanticipated and has caught land managers, conservation organizations, and the wind energy industry completely off guard.The mystery of why bats are so vulnerable to wind turbines remains unsolved. However, several hypotheses have been proposed. Among these hypotheses, those with the most serious conservation implications involve the attraction of bats to turbines. Both the flying insects upon which bats feed and the bats themselves may concentrate their activity around the tallest trees during migration and mating periods, or bats may simply mistake turbines for trees when looking for a place to rest during migration. Hungry, tired, and/or reproductive bats may respond to turbines by mistaking them for the tallest trees and be positively attracted to them when looking for feeding, resting, and mating opportunities.  The conservation implications of these scenarios are grave. Not only do turbines potentially attract bats, but they may also selectively cause the deaths of those that are primed for reproduction and/or resting and refueling during an energetically challenging portion of their annual cycle. Hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) are found dead more frequently beneath turbines in North America than any other species. If hoary bats are attracted to the tallest landscape structures for feeding, roosting, or mating, the current construction of larger, newer-generation wind turbines that extend above the tree canopy on the Hawaiian Islands could have catastrophic effects on Hawaiian hoary bat (L. c. semotus), which is protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.  A swift assessment of the possibility that feeding, mating, and roosting behaviors place bats at risk of collisions with wind turbines is urgently needed.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology 1) Assessing the role of roosting, feeding, and mating behaviors in bats killed at turbines: We will anatomically and histologically examine fresh bat carcasses recovered from a wind turbine facilities in the United States and Canada for evidence of recent mating activity.  The complete gastrointestinal tracts of fresh bat carcasses recovered from wind turbine facilities in the United States will be examined for evidence of feeding prior to collision. Stomach contents of turbine fatalities will be analyzed to determine the composition of diet.  We will also analyze video footage and acoustic data recorded at wind turbines for evidence that bats regularly feed at such sites. Bat behavior will also be observed at turbines and other tall structures with infrared and thermal video camera surveillance systems.  The latter work will focus on gathering evidence of nighttime roosting, feeding, and social interactions among bats around turbines, as well as on collecting information about behaviors of migratory tree-roosting bats other similar natural circumstances.2) Developing new research and monitoring tools for studying bat behaviors and assessing risk: We will continue developing near- and far-infrared video monitoring systems capable of imaging bats and birds flying around turbines at night. Camera systems will be further refined and tested at wind energy facilities on the U.S. mainland and in Hawaii, and additional software tools and analytical methods of automatically processing video data gathered at turbines will be developed.3) Finding new ways of reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines: We will explore new ways of preventing bats from approaching and subsequently colliding with and dying at wind turbines.  Specifically, we will build upon our new knowledge of bat behaviors at wind turbines gained from video observations, which suggest that bats identify and approach turbines using vision.  We will experiment with the novel invention of dimly lighting wind turbines in ways that are visible to bats, but not humans and birds, such as in the ultraviolet spectrum of light.  We will test whether dim ultraviolet illumination of turbines can reduce bat fatalities, while concurrently making additional behavioral observations of bats at turbines at high-fatality sites.  Such observations may further refine our understanding of bats and wind turbines that could help us find better solutions to the problem.  4) Characterizing isotopic variation in a population of non-migratory bats: Animal movement studies that use stable isotopes assume that geographic localities have distinct isotopic signatures (isoscapes) that are reflected in the tissues animals grow there. We will test the isoscape assumption by analyzing the stable isotope signatures (H,O,C,N,S) in fur of a large number of marked, non-migratory bats living in the city of Fort Collins, Colorado.  We will obtain fur samples representing 3 consecutive years from approximately 250 bats per year to assess isotopic variation between individuals, among years, and between known-age bats.  5) Assessing isotopic methods for determining geographic origins of hoary bats killed at wind turbines: We will analyze the stable isotope signatures (H,O,C,N,S) in the fur of hoary bats killed at a wind turbine facilities across the United States.  Analysis will focus on determining the geographic origins of the bats and determining whether they came from specific geographic areas, either near or far from the site of death, if male and female bats came from the same summering grounds, or if they originated from multiple disparate regions.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources - This project will help the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) with the development of scientific information and decision support tools required to effectively manage terrestrial wildlife resources.  In particular, results are intended to assist FWS with the development of adaptive management approaches in the realm of bats and wind energy development. This work will directly support current efforts by FWS, such as the Secretary of Interior's Wind Turbine Guidelines Federal Advisory Committee, to ensure the responsible development of wind energy. Additional DOI agencies actively addressing issues of wind turbines and wildlife include the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.The specific objectives of this project are to:1) Assess the potential role of roosting, feeding, and mating behaviors in the susceptibility of bats to wind turbines.2) Developing new research and monitoring tools for studying bat behaviors and assessing risk.3) Finding new ways of reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines.4) Test assumptions of geochemical methods (stable isotopes) for inferring the geographic origins of bats.5) Assess the efficacy of geochemical methods for delimiting the geographic origins of bats killed at wind turbines.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Continue to represent USGS and the broader research effort into bat fatalities at wind turbines through participation in meetings, publications, information products, and presentations at professional conferences.  All PI generated digital and hardcopy data will be housed at the USGS Fort Collins Science Center and reports will be submitted to the appropriate USGS and USFWS offices upon request. Metadata will be served on the NBII Metadata Clearinghouse.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings During its early stages this project supported synthesis of existing information on bat fatalities at wind turbines, including the first published synthesis of potential causes of bat fatalities at turbines.  Subsequent field and laboratory studies shed new light on the plausibility of possible causes, including mating, feeding, and roosting.  In recent years, this effort has moved toward active observation of bats around wind turbines at night and the new video systems we developed are shedding new light on the issue.  USGS camera systems developed and tested during 2011-2014 are for the first time allowing researchers to automatically record long-term video imagery of bats and birds flying around turbines at night, and our automated video processing approach is working well to help identify the rare instances of bats and birds interacting with turbines during a given night.  This video monitoring work became part of a larger collaborative effort undertaken by researchers from 5 USGS biology science centers and NGO and industry partners.  We have since recorded thousands of hours of video footage of operating wind turbines in Pennsylvania, Colorado, Indiana, and Hawaii and now observed hundreds of bat encounters with turbines.  Our efforts to develop software for automatically finding events involving bats and birds in video footage are showing great promise and we have published sharable software code that we developed with the hope that others will continue to improve and more widely use it.  Among our many new observations of bats at turbines we have seen clear evidence that bats consistently approach and investigate turbines, often exhibiting patterned behaviors that have never before been documented.  We have also seen evidence of both social interactions and feeding by bats at operating turbines. All of these results led us toward exciting new research into a practical method of reducing bat fatalities at turbines--illuminating the turbine structures with dim, flickering ultraviolet light that only bats can see.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments During the summer of 2015 we equipped an operating wind turbine with ultraviolet illuminators at a facility experiencing high bat fatality rates. Worked out optimal placement of turbine illuminators and video cameras used for monitoring bat response. From October of 2015 through winter of 2017-2018 we continuously ran a magnetically mounted thermal imaging camera on a wind turbine at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Broomfield, Colorado, obtaining at least two years worth of nightly imagery, with regular bat observations during the warm seasons. Worked with electrical engineers to help design prototype, dim, ultraviolet illuminators for use on wind turbines.Filed a patent application on the invention of dimly illuminating wind turbines with ultraviolet light as a means of reducing bat fatality (pending).Trained bat researchers interested in bat behaviors at turbines in video methods we developed.

      "\t\tTaskTitle CLOSED-ARMI (beginning in FY09, please refer to Project 3214A90, task 5 for updates)\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Declines of amphibian populations of varying severity have been observed for many years (Bragg 1960, Gibbs and others 1971, Cooke 1972, Beebee 1973, Bury and others 1980, Andrn and Nilson 1981, Hammerson 1999, Corn and Fogleman 1984, Hayes and Jennings 1986, Heyer and others 1994). Concern among conservation biologists increased dramatically after the 1st World Congress of Herpetology in 1989 where evidence of recent declines and discussions amongst the attendees heightened interest about the status of amphibians globally. The consensus of that meeting's participants was that amphibian declines were real but documentation was largely anecdotal, and much work was needed on the causes of declines.Some of the goals established at the Irvine meeting have been met. The last decade has seen considerable progress in documenting status and current distributions of amphibians internationally. Also, studies on public lands in the West document declines of several species in relatively pristine or protected areas, including National Parks.Frameworks have been developed recently to guide programs to detect trends on a national scale (Olson and others 1997, Bricker and Ruggiero 1998). These guidelines emphasize collecting data at multiple scales (both temporal and spatial), selecting samples to allow statistical inference, and integrating research and data on potential stressors to determine causes of trends. Amphibian monitoring in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) will use these guidelines for developing sampling designs, establishing linkages to external data on stressors, and choosing appropriate analyses so that data collected here will be compatible with data from other regions participating in USGS' ARMI program. RMNP was chosen as an ARMI site for a number of reasons. It is a large, natural resource-based park that may provide sufficient sample areas to begin assessing regional trends of some species. A variety of air quality variables are measured at RMNP, allowing assessment of these as potential causes for declines. RMNP is also part of the PRIMENet system, a collection of parks hosting joint NPS/EPA research and monitoring of air quality effects on biological resources. RMNP is one of the PRIMENet sites that already has amphibian research in progress in collaboration with USGS herpetologists. It will be most efficient to use current and past studies at RMNP as the foundation for establishing long-term ARMI research at this park.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology A variety of techniques will be used because amphibians exhibit many life history strategies and occupy a variety of habitats. In RMNP, a majority of the amphibians present are primarily pond-breeders. Methods for sampling pond-breeding species are relatively well understood, and several published guides exist. Sampling protocols used will be comparable with methods used in the ARMI program in similar habitats in the west and northwest. We will use 2 teams of 2 persons each to intensively search selected sites during the breeding season; teams will search designated sites during the day and return to search likely breeding sites at night. Negative data will be collected and incorporated into the resulting database. Daytime searches will continue after the breeding season, but will focus on metamorphs and adults. Disease prevention precautions will be adhered to and will follow standard protocols developed by the Declining Amphibian Population Task Force.1. Apex sites, as proposed in the ARMI plan, are defined as a few locations in each study region where intensive population data are collected. Intensive, long-term observations provide information on the inherent variability of amphibian populations and how populations respond to stressors. An unstated corollary of Alford and Richards'1999 analysis of patterns of annual variation in abundance is that large declines don't occur in stable populations. Therefore, apex sites can provide information on declines. For example, annual assessments of boreal toad populations in RMNP revealed a population crash in one population in 1996 coincident with an outbreak of disease. Apex sites will receive at least 3 visits/ breeding season. Telemetry and modeling projects are also underway at this site. Locations for long-term sites for woodfrogs will be identified in the Colorado River Valley using 1998 survey data. Automated frog call recorders will be installed at these sites and used to collect abundance estimates and assess breeding phenology. Intensive research will include mark-recapture studies. A third apex site exists in the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest. Two populations of chorus frogs have been assessed there since 1969. We will continue to assess at the level of at least 3 visits / breeding season.1.broad scale research and assessments of decline RMNP and other locations-site selection will be based on historical records of amphibians in the park, habitat suitability and accessibility. All sites will be surveyed at least once during the summer season. A subset of sites will be surveyed 3 times / breeding season. Complete surveys will be performed on selected drainages. Drainages will be selected based on habitat suitability. Searches will be Visual Encounter Surveys of littoral and riparian zones. Other techniques and other protocols will be considered as necessary. Abundance data will be recorded: adults/larvae/egg masses.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources- Provide the scientific foundation for the conservation of terrestrial plants, wildlife, and habitats by developing the basic biological information that partners need to formulate adaptive management strategies.  The immediate goal for the initial  phase of this project is to collect presence-absence data and abundance (index values subject to investigation into variability in the proportion sampled) over a large geographical area using proportion of area occupied analyses developed by statisticians working with herpetologists. Abundance index data will be standardized by person hours spent searching and then correlated with various covariates such as date, temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, and elevation. These data will allow us to map presence / absence of amphibians over the areas sampled and will provide guidelines for choosing potential sentinel sites in the future. The overarching goal of this project is to provided research information and to examine the status and trends of amphibian populations in RMNP and in surrounding areas of Colorado and Wyoming in order to contribute to the overarching goals of ARMI as set forth in the National Plan. Specific objectives include:-- re-survey existing and historical amphibian sites in RMNP to determine presence / absence and document evidence of reproduction.--support an expansion of ongoing boreal toad (Bufo boreas) population studies in RMNP.  -- initiate long-term population studies of woodfrogs in RMNP; These studies will estimate numbers of woodfrogs and document reproductive success over time.--Surveys of amphibian presence / absence in northern Colorado and Wyoming.--provide information useful in determining causes of amphibian declines by supporting the development of a DNA-based assay to detect the chytrid fungus in the field; and the initiation of a small scale amphibian health monitoring project in collaboration with NWHC in Madison. While this is a long-term project, useful information about the chytrid fungus and potentially other diseases will be gained.  Short-term results may have immediate consequences for declining amphibians in RMNP (the chytrid fungus has been identified in the metapopulation under study in the park and is responsible, at least in part, for the declines seen in this metapopulation).These objectives contribute to the scientific foundation for the conservation of terrestrial plants, wildlife, and habitats by developing the basic biological information and long term vision that partners, such as the park service need to determine management strategies.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Information gained from this project will be immediately useful to the National Park Service and Forest Service and will be made available in a timely manner through a technical report and on the Internet through the FORT home page. Data will be assimilated into the ARMI program for broad scale, ongoing analyses. The potential for information transfer from the results of this project are substantial and immediate, results will be particularly useful to agencies charged with managing federal lands on which the boreal toad or wood frog occurs (U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service), and those charged with managing populations of amphibians, especially declining populations (Colorado Division of Wildlife, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, and Bureau of Land Management). The Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force, IUCN will also use the information on a global scale.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings We have been using a newly developed method to determine proportion of area occupied for amphibians in certain areas. There are some complications in using this method in areas with naturally depauperate amphibian faunas or in areas experiencing severe declines. These complications are being addressed at ARMI meetings where our data provide a useful example.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED-Adverse effects to northern shovelers from prolonged exposure to treated wastewater from components of a central Front Range Colorado wastewater treatment plant.\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem From Jan to Feb 2007, more than 800 waterfowl, the majority of which were northern shovelers (Anas clypeata), died in or near a number of wastewater treatment plants located along the central Colorado Front Range.  Most of the affected birds were observed at the Denver Metro Wastewater Reclamation District (DMW) facility in north Denver. The sites secondary clarifying ponds and chlorine contact disinfecting basin, the last stages of wastewater treatment before treated water flows into the nearby South Platte River, was the area where most of the affected birds at the facility were found. In Jan 2007, US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW), USGS National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC), DMW, and other wastewater treatment facilities began monitoring the die-off. Observations indicated that affected ducks had problems maintaining their buoyancy, were floating low in the water, and were visibly water-logged in both their body and flight feathers. Dead and dying ducks retrieved from the treatment ponds were found soaked to the skin, emaciated, and showed signs of hypothermia. Preliminary diagnostic analyses by FWS, CDOW, and NWHC laboratories on collected duck carcasses ruled out avian influenza, West Nile virus, or other significant avian infectious diseases. The probable cause of death in these cases was the wetting of their feathers, which reduced the ducks ability to maintain buoyancy, preen, and dry themselves properly, eventually inducing fatal hypothermia. However, how or why the waterproofing of so many ducks failed during this particular cold spell remains unknown.Given the weather, chemical, and physical conditions occurring during this time period, a combination of factors may have been involved to cause this unique die-off scenario. Weather conditions in the Denver Metro area from Dec 2006 to Feb 2007 were unusually cold. The duration of this cold weather caused most of the open bodies of water along the Front Range to freeze, concentrating overwintering waterfowl on to the few available open water areas for food and shelter. The inclement weather may have also increased the amount of time waterfowl would have normally spent on these treatment ponds.This increased reliance of ducks on these treatment ponds also increased their potential exposure to any chemicals present in the wastewater. During the 2007 die-off, waterfowl found alive were transferred from wastewater facilities to wildlife rehabilitation centers where most of these ducks eventually regained condition. However, they did not regain their buoyancy in water until after their feathers had been washed, suggesting the possibility of a surface contaminant present on their feathers. NWHC analyzed feathers collected from duck carcasses with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), noting that a possible polymer substance was present in the feather substrate. However, further chemical analyses of breast plumage rinsate analyses (methylene blue) were negative for anionic surfactants.The extended duration northern shovelers spent on these warm wastewater treatment ponds, without the option of leaving the water surface to feed or preen properly, and the potential exposure to chemicals in the wastewater that reduced waterproofing and buoyancy, may have led to a scenario of body condition depletion and hypothermia witnessed during the die-off. These factors, or a combination of these factors, may have come into play during this time period of unusually cold and prolonged winter weather in central Colorado Front Range. To better assess these potential factors, the goal of this project is to develop a captive duck study to monitor the impacts of wastewater present at the treatment facility on northern shoveler physical and metabolic condition during the winter months along the Colorado Front Range.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We propose a captive duck study onsite at the DMW treatment facility to replicate the conditions that occurred during the 2007 die-off and to monitor how exposure to the different water treatments present at the facility may have altered the physical, metabolic, and behavioral conditions of waterfowl using the wastewater ponds. This study will begin during the winter (Dec 2007-Jan 2008). Northern shovelers will be used in this captive study as the majority of the ducks that died were from this species. Shovelers will be captured from overwintering along the Colorado Front Range to best replicate the genetic, physiological, molt cycle conditions of the ducks involved in the original 2007 die-off (n=15-30). Ducks may be wing-clipped to prevent escape, individually marked with color bands, and placed in a quarantine control tank to assess how wild shovelers will respond to this captive environment. Food will be provided ad libitim throughout the study. Shovelers will be housed in temporary tanks approximately 12ft diameter (113 sq ft area) near the three different water sources found at DMW: 1) a control site using diverted water from the S. Platte River; 2) water from the secondary clarifying ponds; and 3) water from the chlorine disinfecting basin. Tanks will be enclosed to prevent escape by captive ducks or use by wild ducks. Each pond will have floating platforms placed in them to allow birds to get out of the water to preen and loaf.Ducks will be handled daily to take the following measurements: 1) body and skin temperature to assess the potential hypothermic state; 2) body mass (wet weight minus dry weight) to assess changes in body condition; 3) buoyancy/wicking effect by visual inspection of wetting; and 4) collection of body feathers for chemical and surface contaminant analysis. Behavioral observations of ducks in the temporary tanks will be made to develop time activity budgets. The duration for monitoring will be 3-14 days. After completion of the experimental monitoring, shovelers will be humanely euthanized and necropsied, assessments of body condition will be made, and tissue samples will be collected from exposed ducks and shipped for further chemical analyses.At the end of the 2007 die-off, it was suggested that a more detailed chemical analysis on plumage rinsates and feather surfaces be performed. More detailed chemical analytical analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) will be performed for a diverse array of chemical compounds that include both anionic and cationic surfactants to more conclusively identify chemical residue on the feather surfaces. LCMS is an analytical chemistry technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography with the mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry. LCMS is a powerful technique used for many applications where very high sensitivity and specificity is desired. Generally its application is oriented towards the specific detection and potential identification of chemicals in the presence of other chemicals (in a complex mixture). In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze feather surface features for the presence of surface contaminants will be employed. Chemir Analytical Services will use ducks collected during the 2007 die-off at DMW and compare these results against other ducks that died during this winter time period. They will employ LCMS technology in their detailed assessment of the chemicals present in wastewater effluent, their estimates of presence or absence of preening oil or other waterproofing chemicals on duck carcasses, and re-assess the preliminary SEM on feather surfaces to determine whether chemical residue may have been responsible for a breakdown in feather microstructure/integrity, which may have lead to increased wetting/wicking of the feathers.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives OBJECTIVES: The hypothesis of this study is to test whether constituents of wastewater are responsible for loss of feather waterproofing in ducks. This hypothesis is based upon the following: 1)location of dead and affected birds primarily occurred at, or in conjunction with, wastewater treatment facility sites; 2)collection of adversely affected birds from these same wastewater treatment facility sites; 3)lack of detection of significant avian pathogens; 4)gross and microscopic pathology (histopathology) consistent with hypothermia as a sign and potential cause of death in a large number of birds; and 5)the weight of evidence pointing toward chemical(s) exposure as the potential cause for loss of  the birds waterproofing.    We will address this hypothesis by:1) development of a captive duck study to monitor the physical, chemical and behavioral impacts that exposure to the different water treatments may impose; and 2)a more detailed chemical analytical analyses of duck carcass samples from the original 2007 die-off, and samples collected for chemical analysis from the captive duck study (both feather, water, and effluent samples).  For the captive duck study, the main objective is to determine if ducks exposed to the treatment waters generated under normal operating procedures during the winter will have an impact on wetting/hypothermia of exposed birds. The hypothesis will be rejected if: 1)less than 50% of the breast down is visibly wet in test northern shovelers or a lack of hypothermic response to treated water exposure; 2)no statistical difference is observed between control and test northern shovelers relative to the proportion of wetted down breast plumage or physical condition (such as body temperature); or 3)deaths of test birds are determined to be for causes unrelated to a plausible cause-and-effect relationship affecting waterproofing attributable to their exposure to wastewater. Because we are trying to determine whether constituents of wastewater caused the soaking of duck feathers to the point of hypothermic response and mortality, the experimental design of this study is similar to a dose-response study assessing mortality impacts. Ducks will be exposed to their experimental wastewater trials until mortality occurs, or acute signs of morbidity (e.g., inability to keep their head above water and drowning, feather soaking to point of drowning, or declines 10C or greater below an average 39-42C body temperature)occur. Ducks showing acute signs of morbidity (i.e., near death) will be removed from the experimental trial and humanely euthanized. Any ducks that remain at the end of the 14d monitoring period will be humanely euthanized. All the experimental ducks will be necropsied for clinical assessments of body condition, and feather and tissue samples will be collected for further chemical analyses.  The detailed chemical analysis of duck carcasses from the original 2007 die-off is to determine what, if any, chemical components can be detected on the plumages of these ducks, and re-assessment of the SEM performed on duck feathers to detect the presence of any chemical polymers that may have impacted feather microstructure. Also, chemical analysis performed during the captive study will again be used to assess exposure of chemical components to the ducks (pre-, during, and post-exposure to treated waters), as well as SEM to assess any chemical impacts to feather microstructure. Chemical analysis of the treated waters and effluents during the experimental trials will also give us baseline information of the chemical components found in these samples (especially other classes of wetting factors) to compare against the chemicals found on or in duck feather samples. These detailed chemical analyses will also be compared with the routine chemical assessments done at DMW (as required under state and federal health regulations).\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan DATA HANDLING AND ANALYSIS: Data collected in this study will be held jointly among partners USGS FORT, FWS, CDOW, DMW, and Chemir Analytical Services. Laboratory methodology used by Chemir may be proprietary (under their joint agreement with FWS) but the results of their analyses will be provided to other research partners. Data collected by USGS FORT and CDOW personnel will be collated and analyzed jointly.USERS:  Primary users of the information will be USGS, FWS, CDOW, DMW and other wastewater treatment facilities.TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER:  The main product of this project will be to assess in greater detail the factors that may have impacted overwintering northern shovelers and resulted in the large-scale mortality event that occurred over the winter of 2007. We will also assist FWS, CDOW, and wastewater treatment facilities in developing management recommendations on how to monitor, collect field samples, and report if such an die-off event should occur again in the Colorado Front Range. In addition to a final report to project collaborators, results from this study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, as applicable. Metadata generated from this study will be made accessible through the NBII. Primary users of the information will be FWS Region 6, CDOW, DMW, USGS FORT and NWHC, other federal agencies, state and local governments, and other wastewater treatment facilities.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings From January through February of 2007, more than 900 waterfowl, the majority of which were northern shovelers (Anas clypeata), died in apparent association with prolonged exposure to water in or near treatment tanks at a number of wastewater treatment plants located along the central Colorado Front Range. Preliminary postmortem assessments were negative for waterfowl diseases, ingested toxins, or heavy metal contaminants. The probable cause of death for most of these mortalities was the induction of a fatal hypothermia resulting from the wetting of the ducks feathers. To test whether prolonged exposure of waterfowl to chemical compounds in secondary treated wastewater from municipal sources may play a role in the loss of waterproofing, a controlled experimental exposure scenario was developed in which captive, and previously unexposed, live ducks would be subjected to treated wastewater to determine if that exposure, the duration of their exposure, or other factors associated with the experiment adversely affected the waterproofing capabilities of the birds feathers. Experimental ducks (mallards, Anas platyrynchos) were exposed to treated wastewater from the secondary clarifier tanks (n = 5), chlorine contact basin (n = 5), and a control water source (n = 5), and physically assessed every three to six hours for hypothermic responses over the duration of their exposure trial. Ducks exposed to secondary clarifier and chlorine contact basin water began to display signs of hypothermic response (lowered body temperature, shivering, and a reduced ability to maintain buoyancy) within 17 and 12 hours of exposure, respectively, while ducks exposed to the control water showed no hypothermic response over the duration of their exposure trials. To assess whether chemical compounds from the treated wastewater may have affected duck waterproofing in the experiment, liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed on feather rinsates extracted from the exposed ducks and water samples from each exposure tank. The presence of nonionic polyethylene glycol (PEG) surfactant-group compounds were detected in all the feather rinsates (n = 8), including ducks from the control group, and no surfactant chemicals were identified in the water samples. Although the chemical results are inconclusive regarding the impact of nonionic surfactants on duck waterproofing, given the chemical complexity present in municipal wastewater treatment impoundments, more detailed chemical analysis quantifying surfactants in wastewater systems would be required to determine if surfactant groups, combination of groups, or combination of chemical groups and classes, may be causing the effects on waterproofing that were observed during this experiment.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Grasslands Ecology and Conservation\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Grasslands are arguably one of the most anthropogenically-stressed ecosystems of the western United States.  The highly endangered black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) and prairie dogs (Cynomys) epitomize grassland mammals of high conservation concern. The Utah prairie dog (C. parvidens) is a federally-listed species, while black-tailed prairie dogs (C. ludovicianus), white-tailed prairie dogs (C. leucurus), and Gunnison's prairie dogs (C. gunnisoni) all have received attention in the form of listing proposals.  Research within this project will focus on these imperiled prairie dog communities and their vertebrate and invertebrate associates, but will not necessarily be limited to those communities.  Studies will be driven by the need to better understand ecological relationships among grassland animals, interactions of these animals with their environments, and anthropogenic influences affecting these systems.  There will be an emphasis on research with conservation applications.\n",

      "\t\tAccomplishments In 2008, WAFWA recognized the States were devoting considerable effort and funding toward monitoring prairie dog populations; yet the methods used were inconsistent across States, and some methods were subject to criticism, especially for the BTPD.  WAFWA also recognized that because of the different methodologies used, it was difficult to consolidate this information in a statistically rigorous manner to monitor progress towards achieving the target objectives as identified in the MSCP.  In November 2008, after receiving a recommendation from the PDCT, WAFWA and the USFWS requested assistance from the USGS in putting together a workshop to address this concern.  Together WAFWA, the USFWS and the USGS organized a prairie dog survey methodology workshop in Fort Collins, Colorado, during January 25-28, 2010.  A panel of 6 experts in the field of quantitative biology, population biology, species biology, and biostatistics were appointed to review the current survey methodologies used by each State and for each species and to provide WAFWA with recommendations for standardization of survey methodologies for each species of prairie dog.  Prior to the workshop, all twelve States were asked to respond to a set of questions regarding their survey objectives and methods and provide any additional information they would like the panel to consider.  Most States also provided oral presentations at the workshop.  Additionally, one tribe and one nongovernmental organization provided written material and an oral presentation at the workshop. In 2011, a Scientific Investigations Report was published presenting the panels recommendations to standardize survey methodologies among the States for each of the four species of prairie dogs.  In 2011, a 9th dedicated collection of papers was published in Journal of Mammalogy in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of rediscovery of the black-footed ferret at Meeteetse.  The issue contains 8 papers that summarize data collected over nearly the entire 30 years. FORT scientist, Dean Biggins, is an author on 7 of the 8 papers and provides the opening remarks for this special issue. In 2012, a 10th dedicated collection of 12 papers was published in the Western North American Naturalist.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle CLOSED_Feeding ecology of insect-eating bats\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Bats are the only flying mammals that are active mostly at night and occur on all continents except Antarctica.  Bats are ecologically diverse, with a range of lifestyles including species that specialize in feeding on fruit, nectar, blood, fish, small mammals, and insects. However, of the more than 1,100 known species of bats on Earth, the majority specialize in feeding on insects (insectivorous). For example, there are about 45 different species that occur in the United States, of which 42 are insectivorous.  These small creatures of the night are diverse in shape and size, with most relying on echolocation to detect insect prey and find their way through darkness.  Many of these bats form colonies that feed on seasonally available insects from spring to autumn.  Most of these bats use this seasonal feeding strategy to help build fat reserves during the summer and autumn, prior to their hibernation during winter; a time, generally, when insects are not available throughout the United States.  Some of these bat species do not hibernate but instead migrate seasonally.  It is believed that the timing of migration and routes that they take, such as for the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), might coincide with availability of their preferred insect prey.Recently, many of these insectivorous bats have suffered drastic declines in numbers due to new environmental stressors, both natural and human caused.  One of these natural stressors is the emerging wildlife disease known as white-nose syndrome (WNS).  This disease is caused by the fungus Geomyces destructans and has been devastating colonies of hibernating bats in the eastern United States for several years.  At present there is no known cure for this disease and continues to spread north-, south-, and westward.  It is likely that the effects of removing insect predators will influence insect populations, including possible increases in some areas of insects that are economic pests.Like WNS, the development of alternative energy in the form of industrial wind energy facilities is also having a negative effect on bats through collisions with moving turbine blades, often coinciding with autumn migration of bats.  Reasons why certain bats are susceptible to turbines remain unknown, yet feeding on insects may play a role in bat susceptibility. For example, the hoary bat is killed more often than any other species of bat at wind turbines in North America and it is believed that certain prey types (e.g., noctuid moths) consumed by these bats may be locally and seasonally abundant around wind energy facilities.  Despite the high species and ecological diversity of insectivorous bats in the United States, little information exists on their diet.  At FORT, biologists are investigating dietary habits of insectivorous bats, which will help provide insight into questions related to climate change, energy development, wildlife diseases, and conservation.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Guano and other forms of digesta (e.g., stomach contents) will be retrieved from mist-netting efforts, roosts, and  carcasses collected in the field.Diet analyses of insectivorous bats will include traditional methods, such as the dissection of guano under a stereo-microscope with identifications of insect fragments down to the lowest taxonomic level.  Diet analyses of carcasses will include dissection of gastro-intestinal tract with examination of digesta under a stereo-microscope.  Novel methods, such as genetic analyses of insect fragments retrieved from guano and GI tracts, will be explored and used when possible.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED - FWS: Grasshopper Sparrow Focal Species Conservation Action Plan\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Migratory Bird Program has a Focal Species strategy to better measure its success in achieving bird conservation priorities and mandates. The Focal Species strategy involves campaigns for selected species to provide explicit, strategic, and adaptive sets of conservation actions required to return the species to healthy and sustainable levels.  To select Focal Species, the Migratory Bird Program identifies species from the USFWS Birds of Management Concern list (USFWS 2008) that need investment because they: 1) have high conservation need, 2) are representative of a broader group of species sharing the same or similar conservation needs, 3) act as a potential unifier for partnerships, and/or 4) have a high likelihood that factors affecting status can be realistically addressed.  Some Focal Species accounts can be described as full status assessments followed by a conservation action plan, while others have focused primarily on developing just the conservation action plan.  The Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) is listed as a Bird of Conservation Concern (USFWS 2008) for USFWS Regions 2 and 6, and for a number of Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs)  11, 16, 17, 22, 31, 34, and 37.  The Florida Grasshopper Sparrow subspecies (A. s. floridanus) is listed as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and the Arizona Grasshopper Sparrow (A. s. ammolegus) is listed as endangered by the state of New Mexico.  Partners in Flight also recognizes the species as a National Stewardship species (Rich et al. 2004), and it is listed as a priority species in several western state PIF Bird Conservation Plans (e.g., Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana).  In 2012, USFWS chose to begin addressing Grasshopper Sparrow as a Focal Species and initiated plans to develop a conservation action plan for the species.  This project will focus on developing a conservation action plan for the Grasshopper Sparrow.  The primary components of the plan will be a discussion of what is known about threats and limiting factors, population goals and objectives, presentation of recommended priority conservation actions, and methods for evaluating success.  The plan will also include an overview of natural history, range and distribution, population status and trends, legal status, and literature cited and other available references.  The conservation actions will be presented in a table format that presents action items, prioritizes them, identifies a lead party, potential partners, and anticipated outcomes, and as possible, provides time lines and cost estimates for accomplishment.  Action items will include conservation management priorities, as well as the research and monitoring actions needed to inform management, and the outreach needed to accomplish conservation.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The project involves conducting a literature synthesis of information about Grasshopper Sparrow that is pertinent to the development of the conservation action plan.  This species is broadly distributed in North America, with different subspecies experiencing different threats and limiting factors and exhibiting different statuses, so developing a comprehensive action plan will be complicated.  It will involve contacting multiple scientists and managers who are familiar with Grasshopper Sparrow ecology and grassland management.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The objective of this project is to produce a Grasshopper Sparrow Conservation Action Plan that will provide explicit, strategic, and adaptive sets of conservation actions required to return the species to healthy and sustainable population levels.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan The primary product from this project will be a conservation action plan delivered to USFWS Region 6, Migratory Bird Office.  Publication and dissemination of the plan will be the responsibility of USFWS.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The final Status Assessment and Conservation Plan for the Grasshopper Sparrow provides a synthesis of available information about the life history of the Grasshopper Sparrow, its legal and conservation status, range and distribution, population estimates and trends, habitat requirements, and known or suspected limiting factors, management programs and impacts, recent/ongoing conservation actions, and concludes with an table of recommended conservation actions that would need to be conducted to accomplish conservation for this species.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments In May of 2015 the status assessment and conservation plan was published in hard copy.  In August the electronic version of the plan was posted on the USFWS Region 6 website.  This project/task is complete.\n",

      "\t\tMethodology FORT uses an Agile approach to software development and support: All projects operate in two week increments (termed sprints). A development team consists of software developers, support staff, product owners, and a scrum master. The product owners represent project stakeholders, write customer-centric items termed user stories, prioritize them, and add them to the product backlog. Stories can be added to the backlog at any time during the course of the project. This scrum master is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the sprint deliverables and acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. This staff member is also responsible for organizing product testing and project documentation. User stories are selected from backlog at the beginning of a sprint to be worked on during that sprint. During the sprint, the scrum master conducts daily standups and organizes a product owner meeting at the end of each two week sprint. Stand-ups cover what was done the previous day, what tasks are going to be addressed that day, and any blockers that may be encountered. Product owners are invited to call into or attend standups. Product owner meetings have three functions:o The development staff demonstrates progress made during the sprint;o Product owners decide which, if any, of the new components will be included in the next release;o The group collectively selects stories and tasks from the backlog to be addressed in the next sprint (development staff input is required to determine degree of difficulty and estimated time associated with each task). A new release occurs the last day of the sprint.A key principle of this process is the recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need, and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Socioeconomic Considerations for Public Lands Management and Planning\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem DOI and other public land managers require clear and objective guidance on the use of socio-economic information in their land management and planning.  Many agencies are required by law to develop a plan for each unit or complex of public land. (e.g., FWS--Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP); BLM--resource management plan)   These plans generally must contain an analysis of social and economic conditions and evaluate social and economic results from likely management scenarios. The public land managers, planners, and recreation or visitor services specialists are generally responsible for including social and economic assessments in the long-term plan in such a way that understanding these factors aids planning decisions and helps guide management actions. Providing a better understanding of these social and economic considerations in planning is the goal of this task.Visitation to public lands has increased in recent years. Understanding the recreation trends and the social and economic considerations associated with these trends is vitally important to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and National Park Service (NPS).  In particular, the BLM must address the needs of a growing and changing population in the western United States. Ten of the 12 western States with significant proportions of BLM-managed lands have among the fastest rates of population growth in the United States. The agency must balance public demand for recreational opportunities with the more traditional land uses of grazing, timber production, and mining. Similarly, the NPS has experienced phenomenal growth in visitorship and population of gateway communities in recent years, and has added more than 100 new parks added since 1973.   In addressing recreation demand and management on public lands is the focus of this task.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Many different socioeconomic analysis tools are applied to the studies in this task, including surveys, focus groups, non-market valuation, stakeholder analysis, interviews, demographic analysis, and regional economic analysis. Specific methods will be identified in funding proposals submitted to agencies.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Status and Trends, Goal #2:Develop and evaluate inventory and monitoring methods, protocols, experimental designs, analytic tools, models, and technologies to measure biological status and trends.The overall objectives of this task are to 1) conduct social and economic assessments to determine the likely social and economic results of implementing each of the several options for managing public lands as identified in the specific planning process for the agency, 2) assess visitor, community, and stakeholder preferences, knowledge, and valuation of public lands and their resources, and 3) identify obstacles and opportunities in the public process of land management planning.Status and Trends, Goal# 3: Collect, archive, and share selected, critical, high-quality monitoring data in cooperation with our partners to enable a determination of the status and trends of biological resources.This task will identify and describe trends in recreation on public lands, in particular on BLM, NPS, and USFS lands. Also, under this task, research will be conducted that will identify public perceptions and understanding of recreation management and opportunities. It will also evaluate socioeconomic effects of proposed changes to recreation.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The purpose of this project is to develop a social science training module for BLM managers, planners, and recreation specialists. Management decisions and plans regarding Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands generally involve the integrated use of biological, sociological and economic information. Combining this information provides a more comprehensive basis for developing, implementing, and monitoring a plan or management decision. In many cases, an assessment of baseline social and economic conditions and an analysis of potential impacts to these conditions from likely management scenarios are required. Particularly challenging for managers and planners to address are social aspects of planning and decision making, such as assessing public attitudes, knowledge, and values concerning future management scenarios and their implementation. There are many barriers that exist to integrating social science into public land management (Fox 2006). Most BLM managers, planners, and recreation specialists have an educational background in wildlife, biology, fisheries, or recreation. Most were stimulated to enter their profession because of their love of the outdoors and the natural world. Very few have training in the social sciences (Brinson and Benson, 2002) and are not familiar with the variety of methods available to identify, measure and analyze the potential effects. As a result, they may be ill equipped when faced with these difficult social and economic issues.\n",

USGS will also provide narration for the text of the storyboard.  Additional review processes and timelines for subject matter expert reviews will be determined during monthly conference calls.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The objective of this Statement of Work is to develop a web-based social science training module for BLM managers, planners, and resource specialists that would increase the capacity of the agency to address the human dimensions of natural resource management on BLM lands. The goal of this training is to provide employees with a sound understanding of the tools and techniques of the social dimensions of natural resource management through realistic case studies. This training would be the third of three BLM training modules on applying social science to BLM management challenges. Specifically, the objectives for this training module are:1)Identify social interests to be considered in plans, projects, and programs; 2)Identify the appropriate social study area; 3)Identify relevant social research/investigative tools and methods for application to various resource management activities; 4)Consider social effects of management actions in BLM decisions.\n",

This project is intended to provide better information for resource management decisions regarding the social aspects of global climate change, emphasizing social systems that are closely linked to publicly managed lands, waters, and resources, considered at both regional and local scales.  (Social is used broadly to include economic, geographic, political, institutional, and cultural factors.)\n",

Because an effective response to climate change impacts requires cooperation across jurisdictions, this effort is intended to foster effective interagency working relationships and to build a common frame of reference on human dimensions issues. Such a shared framework is a necessary first step in creating common metrics regarding the human impacts of climate change and building quantitative and qualitative datasets at a landscape or regional scale. This project is also intended to explore the bidirectional linkages between biophysical and social systems.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Land managers need to know what specific lands need to restored, protected, and/or managed to most effectively achieve conservation objectives.  The operational dilemma involves issues of scale both spatial and temporal and how to strategically plan and actually take on-the-ground action to achieve maximum results.  Strategic planning efforts continue to identify the need for tools to specifically identify the best locations for on-the-ground habitat actions and equate these actions to a population response at multiple scales for multiple species. Operationally, a better job needs to be done of meeting resource goals and objectives by moving away from a programmatic, opportunistic based approach to habitat restoration and conservation to one that features integrated, landscape-level analysis and planning, and coordinated on-the-ground actions.  In order to do this, tools are needed that readily educate, communicate, track, and help to better coordinate actions and measure results.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology PASA will conduct research and work on developing decision support tools to help guide resource management decisions. The basic methods for decision analysis includes: Identify the players involved with the decision process (decision makers, stakeholders, and experts); Identify proper decision analysis technique to fit the situation.  The technique will vary based on the type of problem being assessed and the players involved in the final decision; Interview decision makers and stakeholders either over the telephone or in person (depending on funding); Organize the attributes identified during the interviews into a structured format (develop hierarchy to describe decision); Determine the relative importance of the attributes describing the decision problem (assign weights); Analyze the set of problem solutions; Review and validate the problem solutions through confirmation interviews with selected players; Create an implementation plan; and report results.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Decision and Prioritization Tools for Land Management Planning\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Lands and resources managed by federal, state, and local agencies provide many goods and services that contribute to the social and economic well being of local communities. These include such benefits as recreational opportunities, commercial uses, ecosystem services, and subsistence. Management actions on these lands and resources can affect various private and public stakeholders who often have diverse values and preferences about the use and management of public resources. Therefore, these social and economic impacts of planning and management need to be adequately and systematically addressed, particularly in controversial situations where diverse stakeholders are highly engaged and may contest management decisions. In fact, many state and federal agencies require that socioeconomic impacts be evaluated as part of their planning processes.Although consideration of socioeconomic impacts is essential when evaluating the possible effects of management actions, many land and resource planners or managers are not familiar with the variety of methods that social scientists and economists use to identify, measure, and analyze these impacts. Furthermore, limited planning budgets and timeframes often constrain the scope of social and economic analyses, requiring identification and prioritization of the most pressing social and economic issues that must be addressed within the management plan (e.g., sensitive or controversial management issues or major changes in management activities). ------------------------------------------------BLM Nonmarket Valuation:The multiple uses which take place on public lands administered by the BLM frequently do not have a market price to reflect their value to society. The total economic value of uses and services such as recreation, wildlife habitat, and improved air quality is captured by quantifying the publics willingness to pay for them, the same measure used to establish market clearing prices in markets for private goods. Willingness to pay in excess of current costs, i.e. consumer surplus, is the accepted benefit measure used in cost benefit analyses performed by federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Army Corps of Engineers. As outlined by the Office of Management and Budget When it can be determined, consumer surplus provides the best measure of the total benefit to society from a government program or project (OMB - Circular A-94). Estimation of changes in consumer surplus resulting from changes in the quantity or quality of public goods is achieved through non-market valuation methods, which have been established through sound economic theory and repeatedly applied and tested through empirical research.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology A prototype of the DSS for economic assessment of National Wildlife Refuges was developed in FY06 by a USGS student contractor for his Masters Thesis project in the Department of Agricultural & Natural Resource Economics at Colorado State University.  A thorough review of the literature relating to the planning policies of the Service was conducted to determine a list of refuge attributes that can contribute to economic value.  The economic methods recognized by the DSS were identified though a literature review of economic methods for public land management, and validated by two natural resources economists (Dr. John Loomis at Colorado State University and Dr. John Bergstrom at University of Georgia).  In 2007 the tool was tested at 3 refuges. In 2010 a workshop of natural resource social scientists and economists was held to refine and set the level of applicability of each tool for each refuge attribute.  The pilot DSS was then refined based on workshop comments. PASA is currently working with three federal agencies to refine and test the revised tool. Once testing is completed, the tool can be expanded for use by additional federal, state, and local land management agencies. --------------------------------------------------BLM Nonmarket Valuation:Once the resource uses and ecosystem services specific to the lands managed by BLM have been identified, updating and expanding of the Wildlife Habitat Benefits Estimation Toolkit will be tailored to these specific uses and services. This will ensure that the Toolkit is applicable to a wide range of BLM decision making. Once the Toolkit is updated accordingly, we propose comparing non-market values estimated through application of various forms of benefit transfer (i.e. value transfer, average value transfer, and function transfer) with previously published primary study estimates specific to BLM lands where overlap in the resource uses and ecosystem services occur. An absolute percent error will be calculated to identify the range of error associated with both value and function transfer. Once the case study locations have been identified and the Wildlife Habitat Benefits Estimation Toolkit has been updated and expanded, USGS and CSU economists, with the assistance of economists at the BLM NOC, will work with BLM field staff to demonstrate how the Toolkit can be used in planning and project assessments.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives To provide a consistent framework for this process, social scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey are developing a Web-based decision tool that will enable planners and managers to develop a custom-tailored socioeconomic assessment plan for their individual land unit and their specific planning issues. Using the tool, planners and managers can identify the broad resource themes they may want to address in their plans; identify sub-issues to assess under those broader themes; and determine the scale of the issue and potential controversy. The Tool uses the information they enter to generate [an outline of] the appropriate methods and level of analysis needed to address those identified issues. This tool will improve the planning process by: systematically covering the breadth of issues facing land and resource management agencies; identifying and prioritizing the planning issues that will require a social and/or economic analysis in the management plan; realistically accounting for budget and time constraints by providing accurate costs of each valuation method; including consideration of appropriate regulations regarding environmental policy; and providing justification and documentation of the chosen analysis and tools. -----------------------------------------------------BLM Nonmarket Valuation: In response to continuing recognition that inclusion of non-market values would be beneficial in at least some of BLMs planning efforts, as well as requests from field staff on how to carry this out, the Bureau is currently in the process of revising its instruction memorandum on estimating non-market environmental values for inclusion in BLM planning. To support this guidance, the study proposed here aims to:&#61656;target three to five BLM field offices to be used as case studies to demonstrate the incorporation of non-market values in resource management plans, project environmental impact statements, and/or project environmental assessments;&#61656;conduct an extensive literature review to determine available literature quantifying non-market values for resource uses and ecosystem services provided by BLM lands; &#61656;work directly with case study field office to address the challenges of estimating non-market values, and the challenges of framing this information and developing clear language for decision-making;&#61656;update and expand a web-based Toolkit based on secondary data of non-market values to facilitate the use of the benefit transfer method in BLM planning and projects;&#61656;conduct validity tests associated with the use of the benefit transfer method; and&#61656;provide training and guidance to BLM field offices to demonstrate the process of incorporating non-market values in planning and project impact statements or assessments.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan ASPN:The policy of the PASA Branch is to require trip reports following each assistance activity.  In addition, brief reports in the form of email memoranda are prepared for client agencies as the need arises.  Longer, USGS series reports are sometimes produced.The intent is to develop the DSS into an interactive web based tool to allow land managers to self-diagnose their land area to determine its full economic value and the most appropriate economic assessment tools for their individual needs. The DSS will be designed as an introduction for public lands planners and managers who need a primer on economic valuation.  It does not provide the analysis, but rather gives managers the needed information to start asking the right questions to properly assess public lands.  ---------------------------------------------------BLM Nonmarket Valuation:Once the case study locations have been identified and the Wildlife Habitat Benefits Estimation Toolkit has been updated and expanded, USGS and CSU economists, with the assistance of economists at the BLM NOC, will work with BLM field staff to demonstrate how the Toolkit can be used in planning and project assessments. This process will require a detailed understanding of the decisions that field staff are addressing, and interaction with the field staff will be a key component of this objective. The results of these case studies will be documented in a guidebook for BLM resource planners and field staff. This will include lessons learned from the case studies, a section of questions and answers that arose throughout the exercise, guidance on empirical application of non-market valuation in BLM decision-making, and practical guidance on when to use the benefit transfer method to facilitate the inclusion of non-market values in BLM planning and projects. It is anticipated that this guidebook will supplement BLMs revision of its instruction memorandum on estimating non-market environmental values for inclusion in BLM planning.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Initial feedback from the planners and refuge managers has been extremely positive. While we had originally envisioned developing the tool to help determine scope & scale needed for a particular refuge, the initial testing has shown support for using the tool DOI wide as a way to consistently assess appropriate methods & level of analysis across all refuges as well as providing documentation on how level of analysis was chosen.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments On April 1, 2014, ASPN will be released for use by the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Forest Service. USGS Fort Collins Science Center economists are providing one last demo of the program to each agency and are discussing rollout plans.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Economic Analysis of Natural Resource Management Issues\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Land managers are often not familiar with the economic methods available to assess the economic activities on public lands or the effects of those activities.  Public lands provide many goods and services including ecosystem services, recreational opportunities, commercial uses, and subsistence uses. When considering changes in management practices, federal land managers must comply with numerous federal requirements such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) which requires economic effects be analyzed and addressed within the management planning process. Public land management can have a direct impact on local communities, in terms of stimulating output and revenue, as well as employment. PASA scientists can help managers resolve this problem.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The methods followed in this task include: 1) Regional impact analysis gives economists information for assessing the equity of a proposed change in public land management.  Economic impact analysis estimates how these variables change with a change in regional economic activity (Stynes 1998). For instance, decreasing timber harvests on public lands could pose a threat to the vitality of the local timber and secondary processing industries. 2) Non-market benefits allows estimation of the value of public lands beyond generating economic activity within the regional economy.  These values include nonmarket benefits that accrue to recreationists, the societal benefits of healthy ecosystem services, fish and wildlife habitat and non-use values, such as existence and option values (Loomis, 2002).  Discussion: Economists have a variety of tools available to measure the diverse values of goods and services promoted by public lands.  The general framework that is used is Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA).  Benefit Cost Analysis is a process of comparing gains and losses from a proposed action in common units (usually dollars) (Loomis and Helfand, 2001).  Whereas an economic impact analysis measures the benefits to the region, economic valuation and benefit cost studies measure benefits to individuals and society (Stynes 1998 and US Department of the Interior, 2003).  For the case of marketed goods, prices and market transactions can partially help with the valuation problem.  For nonmarketed goods, economists measure consumer surplus and willingness to pay to serve as a proxy for how people value such goods.  In the end, nonmarket values are compared to market values in an apples-to-apples context.  For example, the value of a reservoir for agriculture can be directly compared to any negative effects on wildlife.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Status and Trends goal 4: Produce and provide analyses and reports that synthesize information on the status and trends of our Nations flora, fauna, and ecosystems and are responsive to the needs of the scientific community, land and resource managers, policy makers, and the public.The information provided by this task focuses on enhancing the ability of natural resource policy makers to delineate and implement management policies.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan The policy of the PASA Branch is to require trip reports following each assistance activity.  In addition, brief reports in the form of email memoranda are prepared for client agencies as the need arises.  Longer, USGS series reports are sometimes produced.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings In FY07, the PASA initiated work with the USGS Western Geography Science Center for the USGS Landsat Benefit Analysis workplan.  PASAs primary responsibility will be to conduct the socio-economic assessment of Landsat Users groups.  An initial meeting with WGSC will occur here at the FORT in early FY08 to better define research needs, further plan the research that will be conducted in FY 08 and FY09, and establish a timeline for research completion.  PASA also assisted the USGS Western Fisheries Research Center in completing the socio-economic needs assessment and scoping study for sinking of ships in Puget Sound to serve as diving sites for the State of Washington. PASA submitted the following three proposals for future research in FY07: (1) Investigating the Scientiifc and Social Consequences of Altering Crop Plants with Fungal Symbiotes by Aaron J. Douglas and Russell J. Rodriguez (U.S. Geological Survey,  BRD, Western Fisheries Science Center; Seattle, Washington) submitted to the Rockefeller Foundation; (2) Economic Benefits of Pacific Coast Anadromous Fish Habitat Restoration by Aaron J.

      "\t\tAccomplishments The economic research team at the U.S. Geological Survey (Fort Collins Science Center) are making progress on the economic analysis of conserving perennial habitat and rural health in the Prairie Pothole Region.  The project outline and research approach continue to be refined as data and modeling capabilities and limitations are explored.  Currently, the economic analysis is broken down into three major components: (1) an economic contribution analysis to estimate the economic job and income impacts conservation activities  generate in surrounding communities (2) a qualitative analysis regarding the relationship between the amount of conserved habitat, natural rural amenities, and community economic health and quality of life, (3) and an analysis of the non-monetary economic benefits provided by prominent ecosystem services.  Together these three components will address important economic variables, as well as community issues such as resiliency and quality of life.The contribution analysis will estimate the local employment and income effects of recreation taking place on perennial habitat in select areas, conservation land management (ex. wildlife refuge salary and non-salary expenditures), as well as specific restoration programs within government and non-government agencies in the region.  The qualitative analysis is under way with the start of a literature review investigating the relationship between natural rural amenities, recreation opportunities, and rural economic health and quality of life attributes.  Local perceptions and ground-truthing will be further investigated through interviews with county commissioners and other representatives.  Two interviews have already taken place which highlighted landscape and community change and revealed interesting perceptions of local conditions.  The ecosystem service assessment component  will investigate the economic benefits of services such as nutrient loading reduction (i.e. water quality), flood mitigation, carbon sequestration, and habitat suitability.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 requires all units of the National Wildlife Refuge System to be managed under a Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP). The CCP must describe the desired future conditions of a Refuge and provide long range guidance and management direction to achieve refuge purposes. The Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is in the process of developing a range of management goals, objectives, and strategies for the CCP. The CCP must contain an analysis of expected effects associated with current and proposed Refuge management strategies. For Refuge CCP planning, a regional economic analysis provides a means of estimating how current management (No Action Alternative) and proposed management activities (alternatives) affect the local economy. This type of analysis provides two critical pieces of information: 1) it illustrates the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay NWRs contribution to the local community; and 2) it can help in determining whether economic effects are or are not a real concern in choosing among management alternatives.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Users, Uses and Value of Landsat Imagery\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Understanding the societal value of Landsat satellite imagery is essential as future land imaging initiatives move forward. The current Landsat satellites provide no-cost, high-quality, multi-spectral, moderate-resolution imagery for all areas of the world to both U.S-based and international users. The utility of this imagery for monitoring land use change and conducting landscape-level analysis in such areas as climate research and environmental management is well documented, but there is little understanding of how direct users value the availability of Federally sponsored, moderate-resolution land imaging. An even larger unknown involves secondary or downstream users who develop or use spatial data and other products derived from Landsat imagery, but who may not recognize that this imagery underlies their products and decision-making. There have been multiple changes over the recent history of the Landsat program, such as the implementation of the free and open data policy in 2008 and the launch of Landsat 8 in early 2013. These changes have resulted in a constantly changing and expanding user community and opened the door for many new and emerging uses and applications that were not feasible before. In order to understand the impact of these changes to the program, information needs to be gathered on an ongoing basis from the user community. This research is comprised of multiple surveys and case studies conducted over the course of several years which provide longitudinal quantitative and qualitative information about the users, uses, and value of Landsat imagery.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology \n",
      "\t\tObjectives The primary objectives of this research are to: (1)better understand the uses, users and value of Landsat imagery, including the range and types of products that are derived from it (including uses that have previously not been captured or detailed); (2)monitor changes in users, uses, and value over time as changes to the land imaging program occur;(3)investigate the benefits of the imagery in key application areas through case studies.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle 2013 National Park Visitor Spending Effects: Economic Contributions to Local Communities, States, and the Nation\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The National Park System covers more than 84 million acres and is comprised of 401 sites across the nation, and serves as recreational destinations for visitors from across the nation and around the globe. On vacations or on day trips, park visitors spend money in the gateway communities surrounding park sites, which then generates and supports a considerable amount of economic activity within the local, regional, and national economies. The National Park Service requires estimates of the effects of visitor spending on these economies as key indicators of how parks benefit communities and the American public through visitation. This information is important for planning, management, budget formulation, policy analysis, and public outreach.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology 1. Compile a database of visitor spending and trip characteristic data  for units that have conducted a National Park Service Visitor Services Project (VSP) or equivalent study for the eight visitor segments of interest: local day trip, non-local day trip, lodge/cabin in park, camp in park, backcountry campers, motel outside park, camp outside park, and other overnight visitors.2. Analyze the compiled spending characteristic with to generalize or predict visitor spending data and visitor trip characteristics to all other units that have not conducted a NPS Visitor Services Project or equivalent relevant study. 3. Build a custom model to estimate economic effects of visitor spending utilizing spending data by park, visitation data from the Visitor Use Statistics program, and IMPLAN input-output models.  USGS economists will then report economic effects include output (sales), employment (jobs), labor income, and value added at the park unit level, state level, regional level, and national level.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The objective of this project is to estimate the economic effects of spending by park visitors, and how this spending cycles through local gateway economies, generates business sales, and supports jobs and income. USGS economists have constructed a database of existing spending data for sampled park units, extrapolated this data to parks without existing spending data, compiled a database with park visitation estimates, and built a model to estimate the economic effects of visitor spending at the local, state, regional, and national level. USGS economists prepared the first annual report in 2012, presenting the 2012 visitor spending estimates and the 2012 estimates of local, state, regional, and national level economic effects.  This is an ongoing project, and an analysis and report will be prepared annually.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Negotiation training\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Agency managers need training in negotiation of complex multi-party collaborations. Agencies of the Department of the Interior are required by statute (e.g., Federal Power Act; NEPA; Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act; various planning acts; Congressional authorizations of parks, monument, and conservation areas; and Endangered Species Act) to consult on the management plans of federal lands and federal permits and licenses. These collaborative processes often include public involvement programs. These processes also are frequently controversial and contentious, leading to conflicts among stakeholders. Federal resource managers are required to participate in these processes in a manner that maximizes service to the public, is efficient in terms of time and money, and results in a product that meets agency missions. To do this requires federal resource managers to be good negotiators. Social scientists at the USGS, FORT have conducted research, provided training, and published research results on the subject of multi-party natural resource negotiation since the mid-1980s. Researchers at the FORT have become nationally recognized as experts in the field of natural resource negotiation. As a result, agencies of the Department of the Interior and other federal agencies rely on FORT social scientists for negotiation training.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The training component of the task is accomplished through collaborative planning involving representatives from the agencies served (USFS, FWS, BLM). Each training course is carefully evaluated using a student response questionnaire designed by staff of the Colorado State University Department of Organizational Psychology.

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The Policy Analysis and Science Assistance branch (PASA) has long-term experience in offering negotiation courses to natural resource professionals.  PASA has been offering the current series of courses since 2002.  One of the highlights of these courses is the consistently high student evaluations.  PASA uses a 5-point scale, with 5 indicating the most positive evaluation.  Student evaluations of the overall courses have consistently been above the level of 4.0.

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The Legal-Institutional Analysis Model (LIAM) is a model developed by researchers at the USGS.  It has been used in a variety of settings to help resource managers and other stakeholders assess the roles and strategies likely to be present in a negotiation.  The model is used by agencies to understand the multi-party negotiations in which they are involved, especially consultations such as Section 404 & Section 10 permits, FERC licenses, and a variety of other decisions.  However, the software package for the LIAM is old and needs to be updated to be more intuitive and user-friendly. The dated version of the software inhibits effective use. We propose to work with software developers to re-program the software.  We also intend to complete at least one application of the software after the new version is tested.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The LIAM is well grounded in peer-reviewed social science literature (Lamb, Wilds, and Taylor 1993, Lamb, Taylor, Burkardt and Ponds 1998, Lamb, Burkardt and Lybecker 1999).  A previous task required investigation of this literature to determine whether more recent scholarship diverged from the original literature on which the LIAM is based.  It was determined that this was not the case (King and Burkardt 2005).  A second phase involved examining the questions used in the LIAM model; a few changes were made in some of the questions.  The next phases involve testing the revised questions and re-programming the software. The investigators will work with a software developer to determine how to re-design the LIAM program.

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Understanding the parties involved in complex, multi-party natural resource negotiations is essential for successful and effective collaborations.  Case studies of applications of this model are important to develop guidance for managers.  Resource managers must negotiate in a variety of settings to uphold departmental mandates, comply with federal laws and regulations, and protect resources.  These negotiations involve a broad range of interested parties. Using a formal technique or tool to develop this understanding is important because the standards and bases for the analysis are clear.  The Legal-Institutional Analysis Model (LIAM) is a tool that helps parties to a decision understand the institutional opportunities and constraints. This information is used to develop strategy and build coalitions.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology PASA researchers have conducted several LIAM workshops and have reported on these workshops in the peer-reviewed literature.  See, for example, Lamb, B.L., J.G. Taylor, N.Burkardt, and P.D. Ponds. 1998. A policy model to initiate environmental negotiations: three hydropower workshops. Human Dimensions of Wildlife 3(4): 1-17.The researchers will identify a potential LIAM application by working with federal partners.  When the application is selected, the researchers will assist in contacting potential participants, setting up the venue, and other logistical details.  The workshop will take place over a 1.5 day period at a location convenient to the majority of participants.  Participants use the LIAM software to analyze stakeholder groups.  Preliminary results are reported during the workshop, with a more detailed analysis to follow.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Status and Trends: Goal 2: Develop and evaluate inventory and monitoring methods, protocols, experimental designs, analytic tools, models, and technologies to measure biological status and trends. During FY 2007 we propose to conduct one LIAM workshop.  The purpose of the workshop will be to assist a group of stakeholders in developing a better understanding of the roles and power of the parties in the negotiation.  The group will be able to use this information to develop a strategy and to determine potential coalitions.  In future years, if funding is available, we will conduct a case study of the negotiation to determine 1) whether the LIAM outputs were accurate in predicting strategy, power, and coalitions and 2) whether the workshop process affected the dynamics of the negotiation.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Preliminary workshop results will be reported during the final half day of the workshop.A \"Report to Respondents\" will provide more detailed analysis of workshop outputs.  Peer reviewed journal articles (at least one) will follow.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings We did not conduct an LIAM workshop during this FY.  We published a paper in Wildlife Society Bulletin about a series of LIAM workshops conducted in Wyoming.  A key finding of that paper was that state-level managers viewed the process of writing a grizzly bear management plan much differently from other entities and organizations in the state. The state level managers saw the process as one mainly focused on the interests of a relatively small group of state agencies, while the other participants believed that a broader set of interests should be included. This presents challenges to a collaborative process, because if the parties do not agree on the process for making a decision, it is unlikely that they will be able to agree on anything else.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments We reported on the results of LIAM workshops conducted in previous fiscal years. We gave presentations about the results of our LIAM workshops and demonstrated the use of the software to a variety of federal managers.

For the USGS, an evaluation of the Gap Analysis Program (GAP) continued with a chain-referral sampling process to identify users of GAP data and the development of a survey to be conducted in FY09. For the USFWS, a series of information projects and needs assessments were started to help inform the work of the National Conservation Training Center (NCTC). The projects include literature reviews on use of wildlife webcams and barriers to connecting children and nature. Several surveys are planned for FY09 and are in the development process during FY08. These surveys will provide information about training needs and distance education preferences of NCTC's target audiences. The results of these surveys will be used for future planning by NCTC.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Mexican Gray Wolf Recovery and Reintroduction Program Assessment\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In the United States, the Mexican Gray Wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) was reintroduced to the wild in 1998 in Arizona and New Mexico as a nonessential experimental population pursuant to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  The Service is the lead agency responsible for recovery of the Mexican Gray Wolf, however management of the reintroduced population in done in cooperation with State, County, and Tribal entities. As of December 31, 2009, an annual minimum population count in the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area (BRWRA) population numbers approximately 42 wolves; this count is less than half of the reintroduction projects population objective of establishing at least 100 wolves.  Projections estimated that this population objective would be met in 2006.Biological progress of the BRWRA reintroduction project was formerly evaluated in two analyses at three and five years after inception of the project.  Both analyses identified regulatory mechanisms that were slowing BRWRA wolf population progress. These mechanisms include internal and external boundaries, associated regulations limiting release of captive-raised wolves to a small primary portion of the BRWRA, compounded by required capture, and return to the BRWRA, of wolves that establish territories outside the BRWRA.  The two analyses also provided a number of recommendations to improve BRWRA reintroduction progress. The Service and their interagency partners have recently signed a new memorandum of understanding (MOU), which sets the broad groundwork for future collaboration regarding the BRWRA reintroduction program.  An important element of the assessment will be gaining a comprehensive view of the program both from the internal (Service) perspective and from the perspective of our partners and stakeholders. Although substantial progress in implementing the 1982 Mexican Gray Wolf Recovery Plan has been achieved, a revised recovery plan has never been developed.  A newly revised Mexican Gray Wolf recovery plan is needed to establish a long-term recovery vision with recovery criteria specific to the Mexican Gray Wolf subspecies.  A new recovery plan revision effort is expected to begin in early 2011.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology \n",
      "\t\tObjectives 1.Review programmatic foundational documents to gain a general understanding of the program, its legal framework, implementation and previous roles and functions of the Service, cooperators and stakeholders.2.Conduct approximately 15 interview sessions of field and regional Service staff (Directorate, Office Managers, and Program Managers) responsible for and involved with daily and oversight management of the Mexican Gray Wolf Recovery and Reintroduction efforts.  Each of these shall be personal one-on-one interviews and will be conducted in the Regional Office and New Mexico Field Office both of which are located in Albuquerque New Mexico.3.Travel to various facility components of the Project, which will  include, (a) New Mexico Ecological Services Office (Albuquerque, NM), (b) The Regional Office (Albuquerque, NM), (c) the Sevilleta captive management facility (Socorro, NM), (d) the Ladder Ranch captive management facility (Truth or Consequences, NM), (e) the Interagency Field Team office (Alpine, AZ). The purpose of these visits is to interview on-site Federal personnel and to learn about the functions of the captive management facilities.4.Develop a status report identifying accomplishments to date (documents reviewed, interviews completed) as well as interviews scheduled.5.Develop an interim report for Service review. Travel to conduct interviews and, combined with knowledge gained from 1-3 above, understand the scope of the duties involved in the Mexican Wolf Recovery and Reintroduction Program, the complexities of implementation, perceptions of elements contributing towards successes and failures, for a Mexican Gray Wolf Recovery and Reintroduction Program meeting its defined objectives.6.Identify any and all additional information needs to Service representatives throughout the entirety of the assessment and report-writing process.7.Develop a draft report of findings for review by the Service. 8.Develop a final report, briefing paper and provide two (2) verbal summary and discussion sessions.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Analysis of compatibility between USDA and landowner goals using socioeconomic and biological data\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) needs information about the effect of individual conservation practices and effectiveness of administration of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Scientists from the FORT complete biological, social, and economic research relevant to administration of the CRP under guidance from the FSA. The 25+ million acre CRP is present in 47 states affecting the quality and distribution of habitats for resident and migratory species of wildlife far beyond the lands actually enrolled in the program. Work is focused on assisting FSA in refining management actions and policy decisions directed toward achieving long-term provision of wildlife habitats (including species of conservation concern) and other environmental services compatible with farm operations and USDA environmental goals in agriculturally dominated landscapes. The majority of work focuses on periodic management through haying, grazing, prescribed fire, or physical disturbance of grassland covers. Most CRP lands are within the USGS Central Region, however, large acreages also are present within the Eastern and Western USGS Regions.  Assistance furnished to USDA is applicable to other conservation programs (e.g., Wetland Reserve Program, Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program) administered by the USDA associated with agricultural land use that accounts for over 50% of the surface area of the contiguous United States. How these lands are managed has direct and indirect implications for wildlife, water quality, and air quality in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems downstream from enrolled lands. Results and council furnished by FORT scientists are sought and used by USDA as well as state agencies and non-governmental conservation organizations involved in implementation of conservation policies affecting agricultural landscapes.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Under guidance from USDA, field studies will be designed and implemented to address management issues related to conservation lands in agricultural ecosystems. Focus will be on implementation, maintenance and long-term enhancement of lands removed from crop production and planted to conservation covers (e.g., native grasses) to maximize acceptance of programs by landowners, capitalize wildlife habitat and ensure financial effectiveness of conservation policies and practices.All work occurs on private lands. Study objectives, methods, and requests for assistance ( e.g., data on field locations management practices) from state and county FSA offices are cleared through Washington level Economic Policy Analysis (EPAS) staff or Conservation and Environmental Programs (CEPD) staff. Purposes of study are then communicated downward to FSA State Executive Directors (SED) and County Executive Directors (CED). Landowners of potential study fields are then notified in writing about study objectives, methods and requested to provide written permission to enter private lands. Written documentation of field location, conservation practice, CRP enrollment data, legal description (i.e., subsection, section, township, and range) of the study field are provided to the landowner.Written or verbal permission for trespass is obtained by investigators when work is being completed. When plausible letters are sent to landowners reminding them that USGS staff will be visiting their field. Within the letter, a vehicle description and approximate date that field work will be completed is provided. In more densely populated regions, where fields can be physically seen from a nearby farm house, investigators will physically visit the landowner to discuss the project. USGS visual identity clothing is worn when completing field work on private lands.Data collection and study design are based on repeated measures (years) in control and treated paired fields. Data including species composition, vegetation height, density, litter cover, etc. are collected in spring (pre-greenup) and midsummer depending on objectives and management activities data are collected in sequential or alternate years.  When research includes survey data, the data will be designed, implemented and collected according to strict OMB guidelines.  Landowners may be contacted multiple times via mail to inform them of the upcoming survey, to deliver the survey, and to thank them for completing the survey.  All studies conducted by or supported by U.S. Geological Survey FORT involving maintaining or handling live animals will conform to the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), Interagency Research Animal Committee (IRAC), and the Good Laboratory Practices Act (GLP).  Under the AWA, FORT is required to establish and maintain an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Scientific support related to wildlife issues and management of lands enrolled in USDA Conservation Programs continued throughout the year. The USDA needs help defining and implementing their conservation objectives borne from past Farm Bills. As a result, a comprehensive report, largely based on our work over the last decade and other relevant CRP wildlife studies was published. A comparative assessment of amphibian health, survival and populations across multiple wetland types in Iowa showed constructed wetlands function similarly to remnant wetlands. No significant differences were found when we analyzed different wetland types for herbicides and chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis Bd). An assessment of native pollinators and associated plants in eastern Colorado CRP fields that began in FY12 was completed in FY16. Fields recently planted for pollinator habitat were paired with general sign-up CRP fields and row crop fields to evaluate richness and diversity of native pollinators in those fields. Preliminary data results show no significant differences in pollinator diversity and richness between fields planted for pollinator habitat and general sign-up CRP fields. Native bees were captured, identified and sent to USGS Northern Prairie research center to support their pollinator library.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Assessment of USDA Conservation Reserve Program for Grassland Bird Habitat, Pollinator Habitat, and Durability of Conservation Practices\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The wildlife and pollinator habitat, water quality, and soil erosion benefits attributable to the CRP literally depend on what is on the ground. While the practice requirements stipulated in program contracts certainly provide an indication of cover condition and quality and, thus, program benefits, on-site assessments are essential for making those estimates accurate and defensible.There is considerable latitude in what is actually done on enrolled land to satisfy practice requirements. Potential conservation benefits cannot be achieved when under- or noncompliance occurs. Coordinated site visits can reveal compliance issues and better quantify program benefits. Wildlife and pollinator habitat, soil erosion, and water quality benefits do not cease upon contract expiration. On-site assessments of expired, as well as currently enrolled CRP lands enable the program to take credit for benefits that continue to accrue for as long as the conservation covers persist to at least some degree.The purpose of this agreement is to authorize a cooperative effort between USDA andUSGS to improve CRP benefit estimates by conducting on-site assessments of fieldscurrently and previously enrolled in the program. More realistic and defensible estimatesof the benefits generated by CRP strengthen the case for the program and provide a basisfor making policy changes that improve it.FORT will lead the project for USGS, and develop a rapid assessment tool to assesswildlife and pollinator habitat, soil erosion, and water quality benefits of coversassociated with select CRP practices, as well as adherence to practice requirements.FORT will then apply the tool at a sample of fields currently and previously enrolled inCRP, and use the results to estimate the distributions and spatially explicit models neededto inform policy.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Museum curation\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem This project covers collection-related and curatorial activities connected with care and maintenance of a large and valuable collection of vertebrates belonging to USGS, BRD, and its predecessor agencies. This collection is one of two such research collections managed by personnel of BRD, excluding some small specialized collections at other science centers. As such, this is an ongoing work unit that does not have a termination date, as care of the collection is a non-expiring responsibility.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Care and management of the vertebrate collection is governed by strict museum guidelines and policies that are established by various scientific disciplines.  As such the Collection Manager (Museum Specialist) must keep informed of changing procedures and policies by attending professional natural history collection meetings and workshops, and establishing professional affiliations with other museum professionals.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Status and Trends of Biological Resources - Provide a framework that facilitates the integration of information from a variety of sources at multiple spatial and temporal scales to describe and track the abundance, distribution, productivity, and health of the Nation's plants, animals, and ecosystems.  1)  Provide longterm care and management of the USGS Biological Survey collection of vertebrates; 2)  Document distribution records of vertebrates from the Southwest by collecting and depositing vouchers in the USGS collection.3)  Provide guidance and museum curation expertise to DOI clients and museum colleagues.4)  Provide vertebrate identifications, loans, and other services to DOI clients in particular, and museum users in general.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Communication is typically direct by letter, email, or telephone and is often in response to incoming questions about the collection, curatorial procedures, specimen holdings, and the like. When appropriate, papers are given at regional, national, and international meetings on aspects of the collection, including moves, status, growth, and research on collections; and may be published in peer-reviewed journals.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between USGS and UNM signed in July 2007 was extended until July 2013 through a one-year amendment. This agreement continues our long-standing cooperation on museum matters with the University of New Mexico. The UNM-USGS Cooperative Agreement, which covers space and laboratories, was renewed in June 2009. The mammal collection at MSB was reaccredited by the American Society of Mammalogists during the annual meeting in Albuquerque in June 2008, thanks to efforts spearheaded by USGS and MSB curators and collection managers.  The number of inquiries about the amphibian and reptile, bird, and mammal collections has grown exponentially due to the availability of the specimen data on the World Wide Web.  USGS scientific collections represent an important archival source of historic, recent, and new information, and care of the collections is an ongoing responsibility without an expiration date. Long-term support by USGS is needed in keeping with the recommendations made by the Interagency Working Group on Scientific Collections in the Report on Federal Scientific Collections (December 2008).The collections in Albuquerque are classified as museum property by DOI. They are the only zoological collections managed as museum property by USGS, and represent 98% of all USGS museum property. An audit by the Office of the Inspector General in late 2008 found that DOI is failing to fulfill its stewardship responsibilities over museum collections. DOI attributed the deficiencies identified in the report to the lack of funding and staff. The collection in Albuquerque was the only USGS audited by OIG as part of the inspection and received a perfect score (no deficiencies).\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments The USGS Biological Surveys Collection in Albuquerque consists of voucher specimens that have documented the distribution of vertebrates from western Federal lands for almost 100 years. The collection is regularly put to use by both USGS biologists and by the international scientific community.  Examples of such studies and programs include: inventory and monitoring of vertebrates on national parks and other federal lands throughout the western and central United States; investigating the taxonomic relationships and geographic distributions of species of federal concern; using specimen occurrence records and stable isotope analysis to determine continental patterns of migration; studying the past and current dynamics of infectious diseases (e.g., Hantavirus in small mammals and chytrid fungus in amphibians); and comparing the past and present diets of animals from preserved and newly acquired specimens.  Because of the historic emphasis of conducting biological surveys on public lands, the collection today is one of the largest collections of vertebrates from Federal lands in the western United States. The number of inquiries about the amphibian and reptile, bird, and mammal collections has grown exponentially due to the availability of the specimen data on the World Wide Web.

      "\t\tTaskNumber 2\n",
      "\t\tTaskTitle Consolidation and Integration of USGS/UNM Collections\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In January 1994, the USGS moved its bird and mammal specimens formerly housed in Fort Collins to the University of New Mexico under a formal Cooperative Agreement. This agreement noted that the remainder of the collections in Fort Collins would be relocated and that as soon as practicable, steps would be taken to integrate both the physical specimens and the associated electronic databases, so as to greatly improve user access. Maintaining the USGS and University collections separately is inefficient from the standpoint of collection curation and management, and presents serious problems for collection users. The integration of collections and databases will more efficiently use the available research and collection resources on campus.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will update and make specific types of global changes to the existing USGS mammal database prior to moving the electronic records to ACCESS. This will be done in concert with University personnel moving their records to the same software.  Once the records are transferred and any resulting problems solved, we will begin to combine the two databases.  We prefer to wait until relocating both USGS and University collections to new space to begin the verification and physical integration process of the mammal collection because the new facilities will offer much better layout and work space than our current facilities.  In December 2004 the computer system was changed from an Access-based platform to an Oracle-based platfor 4. This interactive database, Arctos, is much more powerful and quick, and allows for the integration of projects, Genbank information, and publications with the specimen database.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Biological Informatics - Apply innovative technologies and best practices to improve the collection, description, and dessimination of biological information to our customers. 1) integrate both the physical specimens and the associated electronic databases, so as to greatly improve user access.2) verify and correct mammal catalog records by direct comparison with specimen labels.3) enter new catalog records into the applicable databases for each division (Mammals, Herps, Birds, Fishes).\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Users of the combined collections and databases include biologists in academic institutions, other museums, state and federal agencies, non-governmental agencies, the public, and client DOI agencies.  Web access to the combined bird and mammal databases of USGS and UNM is now available and users worldwide can access the database.  Specimen data for USGS and UNM amphibians and reptiles have been merged and the combined database of 86,602 records is now available online through several portals, including HerpNET <www.herpnet.org>.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The vertebrate collections and databases of the USGS have been maintained separately from those of the UNM Museum of Southwestern Biology since 1994. This arrangement has been ineffective from the standpoint of collection management and availability to researchers. To facilitate both maintenance and availability, physically combining the collections and databases has been the common goal of both UNM and USGS. To date, the successful integration of USGS specimens of fishes, amphibians and reptiles, birds, and mammals with those of UNM has facilitated the use of the specimens and their associated data to the greater scientific community. As a result, use of federal specimens has resulted in the annual publication of scientific papers that have expanded our knowledge in the fields of systematics and taxonomy, phylogeography, animal distributions, and impact of climate change on vertebrates, to name a few. Federal museum specimens have been used to compare present and past conditions in animals for such phenomena as changes in climate, genetic diversity, shifts in distribution, stable isotope analysis to determine wintering or breeding grounds, occurrence or prevalence of disease, exposure to toxins or contaminants, and changes in population size.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments Integration of the USGS amphibians and reptiles was completed in June 2008. We incorporated 12,530 specimens into the MSB collection, completed a 100% inventory of the USGS specimens, and proofed all specimen data against the specimen tag. All specimens were transferred to new standard jars, new thermal labels were printed and installed, and all alcohol was replaced with fresh alcohol. We also updated the taxonomy, cataloged several unprocessed collections, and ensured that all USGS amphibian and reptiles were individually catalogued. Integration of the USGS and MSB fish collections was completed 30 January 2009. The effort involved a 100% inventory of the USGS fishes (265,000 individual fishes or 4,683 cataloged lots) and allowed us to proof the specimen data in the electronic database against the handwritten museum catalog, and incorporate current taxonomy. In the process, we went through 10 55-gallon drums of 99% isopropyl alcohol, and printed and inserted new labels printed on a thermal printer for all USGS specimens. The federal specimens are primarily from the Colorado and Missouri River drainages, and included approximately 30 taxa new to the MSB collection. We completed physical integration of the (dry) mammal collection in April 2011. This included not only 23,000 USGS specimens but a collection of 32,000 specimens from the University of Illinois Museum of Natural History that was acquired by the University of New Mexico in 2008. Although not part of the original integration effort, the UIMNH collection was integrated concurrently with the USGS collection to foster efficiency.  Integration of the fluid-preserved (\"wet\") mammals was completed in March 2012. This involved 3,000 specimens and included replacing alcohol and upgrading jars, and printing new labels. This effort effectively completed the integration of all catalogued USGS specimens into the MSB collection. Online searchable queries of the mammal and bird databases are available via Arctos, a powerful Oracle-based platform that allows for the integration of projects, Genbank information, and publications with the specimen database. The amphibian and reptile database is available online through several portals, including HerpNET <www.herpnet.org>. The number of inquiries about the amphibian and reptile, bird, and mammal collections has grown exponentially due to the availability of the specimen data on the World Wide Web. The integration of the USGS and UNM amphibian and reptile collections was announced to the museum community through Herpetological Review and the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections newsletter. While the USGS specimens are property of the U.S. Department of the Interior, and primary responsibility for their care and management will rest with USGS, integration of the specimens and their associated data with MSB facilitates their use by the greater scientific community.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Many professional activities that are important in the scientific research process do not fall neatly within specific research tasks.  These activities are covered here under the general task of technical assistance and research program development, service to national and international scientific societies (including providing scientific peer reviews), and providing technical assistance based on scientific expertise developed over the careers of the scientists.  As research tasks conclude, there is a need to spend time exploring possibilities for future research - identifying priority needs, opportunities, and funding possibilities.  Ongoing communications between USGS and the various land management, private, and research agencies with which we work will ensure that priority research needs regarding conservation biology of terrestrial vertebrates and avian species in arid lands are met in the most effective and efficient manner, and that the resulting information is disseminated to those who will use it.  In addition staff routinely respond to technical assistance questions from staff of client agencies.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Development of new research projects will be accomplished by communicating with all necessary/possible client bureau contacts and funding sources, and by conducting background research (e.g., literature searches) to develop proposed methods and research focuses.  Improved communications will be achieved through attendance at or organization of meetings that facilitates the exchange of information about research needs and results, and discussion of future needs, planning, and funding.  This might involve attendance at existing scientific or management meetings, or separate meetings specifically organized for this purpose.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Institutional Response Index System (IRIS)\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem One obstacle to effective response from Federal resource managers to disaster events is uncertainty about the resilience of community institutions.  Because federal agency personnel must respond to community concerns when faced with problems requiring policy interventions, we propose to develop a tool, the Institutional Response Index System (IRIS) that would facilitate understanding of the obstacles and opportunities for achieving community or regional support for solving these problems.  The IRIS will also allow managers to predict areas of likely conflicts and will present these areas in an interactive web-based GIS format.IRIS could help managers answer questions such as:Are communities prepared to respond to environmental threats such as disasters, Chronic Wasting Disease, West Nile virus, and other similar events?How do existing land ownership and management patterns affect the spread or exacerbation of these events or threats?What kinds of institutions or structures of governance are best suited to dealing with these events?\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Investigators will develop an index consisting of items contributing to institutional responsiveness to environmental events or threats. The items in the index will be selected based on previous research in the areas of public administration, risk assessment, and other fields. The index will employ hypothesis testing as a means of defining the appropriate items in the index and their relative weights. Researchers will also conduct workshops with community members and local officials in selected locations to obtain feedback on items initially selected for the index, and will revise the index based in part upon these workshops.  Peer review will follow this step. After these indices are constructed, investigators will develop interactive GIS maps. These maps will allow decision makers and others to build scenarios and predict the likelihood of conflict so that proactive measures can be taken to ensure protection of human safety, wise use of valuable natural resources, and opportunities for collaborative problem solving.  Progress is dependent on available funds.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Status and Trends - Goal 2: Develop and evaluate inventory and monitoring methods, protocols, experimental designs, analytic tools, models, and technologies to measure biological status and trends. The objective of this task is to develop a tool (IRIS) to help managers and planners assess the capacity of local and regional institutions to respond effectively to a disaster or hazard.  A better understanding of the factors contributing to responsive and resilient institutions will allow pre-event strengthening of institutions and efficient and effective post-event response.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan We will publish papers in peer reviewed journals, deliver presentations at professional meetings, and provide reports of workshop results (\"Report to Respondents\") to those who participate in workshops to help refine index items.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings We are in the process of completing an updated literature review for this task.  The literature on resilience, generally, has become very active in the last 18 months or so, with an increasing number of published journal articles.  However, most of the literature is theoretical with little or no discussion of practical applications of the concepts. Researchers seem particularly interested in the questions of 1) how to establish an appropriate scale for measuring resilience and 2) how to identify and measure indicators of resilience. We plan to make a first cut at identifying and measuring indicators in FY 2007.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Federal, State, and local agencies committed significant resources providing geospatial data in support of response and recovery efforts associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  USGS personnel throughout the country from all disciplines contributed to the development of GIS for the Gulf, and compiled, collected, copied, and delivered geospatial data.  Eleven Fire-wire drives with 25 GB of data were developed by USGS personnel and delivered to first responders in the Gulf Region on 9/26/05.  A significant number of hours were devoted to discovering, retrieving, developing agreements, standardizing and storing the data.  Anticipated uses of the data included rescue and recovery, assessment of damages, outreach/public display to help communicate activities to others.  Research Question:  How were geospatial data used or not used in a well-documented natural disaster?\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Compile a summary of the types, sources, providers, media, and timing of delivery of geospatial data; we interviewed USGS personnel to determine how geospatial data were compiled/developed.  The purpose was to determine how decisions were made to include or exclude specific types of data or whether data identified as potentially useful were unavailable.  The responses were coded, compiled in a database, and analyzed. To assess data use we will quantify what data were used and how the data were used; oIdentify factors that made the data useful (timeliness, scale, format, type, best available)oIdentify data that were needed but were not available, either publicly or commerciallyassess why data were not available.oAssociate factors with the personnel using the data (helicopter, boats, automobiles)oAssociate factors with how the data were used (rescue (day, night, mode, etc), police action, recovery, planning, etc)Compile lessons learned;Prepare report describing results of assessments\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Using genetic tools to obtain information about the biology of summer roosting Indiana bats - Pilot Study\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Despite the fact that the Indiana bat has been more intensively studied throughout their range than most other North American bats (Kurta In Press, Ellison et al. 2003), managers continue to lack basic information about population dynamics on the summer range.  This lack of information is primarily a result of limitations associated with traditional techniques.  Traditional techniques do not provide researchers with the ability to regularly monitor individual bats throughout a field season.    Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques have made it possible to uniquely identify individual animals. These techniques are currently being applied to the study of mating systems, mating success, and genetic relatedness (Murphy 1998, Semple et al. 2001, Burland et al. 2001), studies documenting individual movements (Ernest et al.  2000, Lucchini et al. 2002), and for forensic applications.  Additionally, because each individual animal has a unique molecular fingerprint that remains with them throughout their lifetime, biologists have begun to attempt to use DNA as an individual mark for mark-recapture studies.  DNA samples can now be obtained non-invasively as DNA has been successfully extracted from hair, feathers, feces, and even frozen urine (Foran et al. 1997, Ellegren 1991, Ernest et al. 2000, and Valiere and Taberlet 2000).  Mark-recapture methods using DNA as an individual mark have been used successfully to estimate population sizes of humpback whales (Palsboll et al. 1997), mountain lions (Ernest et al. 2000), coyotes (Kohn et al. 1999) and Pyrenean brown bears (Taberlet et al. 1997).    Because the need for accurate demographic and relatedness information is great for the management and recovery of the Indiana bat, we propose to develop molecular genetic markers and optimize DNA extraction techniques with the goal of assessing the feasibility of using of DNA collected from Indiana bat feces to uniquely identify individual bats for the purpose of investigating genetic relatedness and for mark-recapture studies to estimate survival rates and population sizes.  Although DNA has been successfully been extracted from feces and used in this manner for a number of other mammals, it has not been perfected for bats, although one study was able to successfully extract DNA from captive big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in a controlled setting (Vege and McCracken 2001) and Carter et al. (In Litt) have used fecal DNA to separate Indiana bat from little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) when the two species cohabitate.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Field TechniquesCapture and tracking of bats.We propose to capture and radiotrack at least 10 Indiana bats from two field sites per year to both their foraging and roosting locations.  Emergence counts will be conducted twice per week throughout the field season on primary roosts discovered by telemetry. Bats will be captured in 50-denier, 9-m mistnets strung near known roosts, and across steams.  Once bats captured, bats will identified to species, sex, and reproductive conduction.  Each bat will be held in a plastic bag for 5 minutes, or until it defecates.  We will also collect a wing biopsy from each bat.  These samples will be sent to the USGS lab in Denver where they will be used to verify that genetic identifications made from fecal samples are accurate (See Below).  Bats weighing 6 of more grams will then receive a 0.49-g radiotransmitter (model LB-2, Holohil Systems Ltd, Carp, Ontario, Canada), which will be glued  to the back of the bat using colostomy glue (Skin-bond, Smith and Nephew, Largo, Florida, USA).  These transmitters will then allow us to track the bats to roosts.  Molecular Techniques Uniquely identifying individual Indiana myotis requires the use of a suite of highly polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers so that individuals can be fingerprinted.  Microsatellites have been developed for two related species.These microsatellite loci have been shown to amplify across closely related species and will be screened using DNA from the Indiana myotis to determine whether any will work in this species.  Additionally, we will isolate a suite of microsatellite loci specifically from the Indiana myotis.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial - Evaluate the status of plant and animal species at risk and provide scientific guidance for their conservation and management.Primary Objective: Our main objective is to extract DNA from Indiana bat feces and use it to uniquely identify individuals.  This will require optimization of the DNA extraction process from feces, which has not yet been successfully done on this species.  Further, we will screen all existing myotis microsatellite primers as well as isolate a suite of highly polymorphic microsatellites specifically from the Indiana bat with the goal of reaching a high enough resolution that we can uniquely identify individuals.  With this information, it will then be possible to examine the cost and feasibility of addressing the three following objectives using fecal pellets as a non-invasive source of DNA.1) Determine the feasibility of using DNA collected non invasively from Indiana bat species to investigate behavioral or genetic structuring within the maternity colonies. 2) Determine the feasibility of using DNA as an individual marker to uniquely identify individuals for use in population size estimation of maternity colonies. 3) Determine the feasibility of using molecular tagging techniques to examine patterns of survival between years.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan In the early stages of this project, preliminary results will be presented at annual mammal or bat meetings as well as some national conferences (e. g., The Wildlife Society).  In later stages, results will be presented in manuscript form and submitted to peer review journals.   Primary users of the information generated by this research will be land management agencies, federal and state governments, universities, and non-governmental organizations. The current anticipated users of this information will include US Geological Survey, US Fish and Wildlife Service, Indiana State University, University of Denver, and The Rocky Mountain Center for Conservation Genetics and Systematics. Data and technology transfer will be accessible through presentations, publications in a peer-reviewed journal and accessing data generated from federally funded programs through the NBII.  Final reports, presentations, and journal publications to partners and collaborators will be made available to all interested researchers and resource managers for consideration of incorporating these results into their management programs. More importantly the products obtained from the molecular research will give the opportunity to integrate research techniques, increase collaboration, and provide new approaches for future research at the USGS.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings We have shown that we can reliably extract DNA from Indiana bat fecal pellets collected under roost trees and use them for microsatellite analysis.  DNA was successfully extracted from each pellet that we attempted, although the success rate of amplification at all loci varied.  Due to the exploratory nature of this pilot study, we did not repeat PCRs on pellets that had lower amplification rates, however, this could be attempted in future work.  Further, we have tested existing loci and developed new loci and have shown that a small number of the most informative loci (5) can be used to uniquely identify individuals.  These loci can also be used to determine relatedness among individual bats roosting in a tree.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments This pilot study has shown that DNA can successfully be extracted from single Indiana bat fecal pellets collected from underneath roost trees.  Successful DNA extraction from fecal pellets of related bat species has only been accomplished once before, in a controlled laboratory setting (i.e. bats were held in bags until defecation at which time the feces were immediately frozen) and in that case, several pellets from each bat were pooled for extraction purposes (Vege and McCracken 2001).   Additionally, we have isolated and developed primers for a suite of highly polymorphic microsatellite loci that can be used not only for unique identification of individual Indiana bats but for population genetics and studies of relatedness.  It is likely that some of these new markers will work in other closely related bat species.  Finally, we have shown that our techniques and new markers can be used to gather a variety of data regarding Indiana bats including information about demographics (e.g. population size, survival rates, and individual movements), social structure (e.g. relatedness of individuals in roost trees), and population structure.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Estimating Sage-grouse demographic parameters using DNA as an individual marker for Mark-Recapture analysis\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Capture-recapture (CR) is a very important class of methods and models for study of wildlife populations. The methods of particular interest here arise from live capture-mark-recapture methods for closed and open population models. These methods are used to estimate population abundance, survival probabilities, population trends and obtain movement information. Often, CR is the only approach to obtaining reliable quantitative population information for science and management. In the past 15 years there has been a veritable explosion of useful (and much used) models and associated computer software for analysis of CR data. A critical aspect of these methods is that the mark used on the animal must be unique, and permanent, for each individual animal. Historically, the animal was physically captured in order to apply a visible mark or tag (for some species recaptures can be by resighting).However, the capture process can be quite problematic for animals such as grizzly bears, and mark (tag) loss can be a problem. Just in the past few years it has become feasible to consider using an individual's unique DNA as its mark. Such DNA marking\" has great potential advantages when capture\" can be related not to the animal, but, for example, to hairs, feathers, or feces. Recognizing this potential, biologists have explored some aspects of DNA-based application of CR models (DNA-CR) to estimate population parameters. However, using DNA as a mark is not without problems from the standpoint of CR study design and analysis models.Experts in the area of CR theory have not developed rigorous inference methods to underlie and support these studies. There is an urgent need to develop methods for designing studies such that the data are appropriate for analysis, leading to proper, well supported statistical inferences. It is time for a statistical-theoretical evaluation of this new application of CR with regard to design issues for DNA capture,\" issues about being able to read individual DNA as unique (some mis-reads must be expected), and any new analysis models that will be needed in user-friendly software such as program MARK (White and K. P. Burnham 1999, White et al. in press).  This study will use a known set of samples (Gunnison Sage-Grouse) to test the assumptions currently used in DNA CR studies.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Gender identification of white-winged doves\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem White-winged doves (Zenaida asiatica) are migratory game birds with an expanding distribution (George et al. 1994). The reasons for the range expansion are largely unknown as are the characteristics of populations in newly occupied areas. This species is avidly sought in states having large whitewing populations and where it is hunted with specific hunting seasons designed to prevent local over-harvest. Increasing distribution and apparent population size in other states may result in legalizing or liberalization of hunting regulations in those states. Prior to any liberalization, more knowledge is needed on population characteristics including population demography in both the Central Flyway and Pacific Flyway portions of the species range. These needs should be specific by age and gender class as hunting may over exploit one gender (or age class). Harvest rates may be measured through banding programs; these rates should be gender specific to examine possible rates of hunting loss on population composition, which could affect breeding population size. Harvest by gender can also be measured through use of hunter bag checks and collections of specific parts though parts collection surveys.Gender of white-winged doves based on examination of live birds is difficult even though Cottam and Trefethen (1968) indicate that it can be done based on plumage coloration. Russell (1969) suggested that body mass was a reliable method for assigning gender to white-winged doves. However, Brown et al. (1977) indicated the only useful method to correctly assign gender to white-winged doves was through cloacal examination. This method was further tested (Swanson and Rappole 1992) on a small sample (52 live birds captured on nests and 25 shot birds). These authors reported that all 26 presumed males (captured on nests, cloacal papillae observed) and those shot and dissected (23 males) had cloacal papillae. However, the opening to the oviduct was found on only 22 of 26 presumed females (captured on nests) and on 2 of 2 shot and dissected females. These authors claim that cloacal examination should result in a level of accuracy of at least 90%.Cloacal examination takes time and, especially in warm climates, can be stressful to the birds. Further, it takes experience and leaves doubt as excreta can obscure either the 2 papillae (males) or the oviductal opening (females). Further, it is ineffective in hatching year birds and in some second-year individuals. Thus, there is a need for a rapid and effective method to ascertain gender of white-winged doves in banding programs, especially those that are likely to result in capture of large numbers of individuals. Our preliminary work suggests a method is available to accurately classify captured white-winged doves by gender.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Field MeasurementsA central brown tail feather will be plucked from a sample of at least 100 white-winged doves captured in normal banding operations. Feathers will be labeled by band number, measured (mm) fresh, and stored dry. Prior to further analysis, dried feathers will be measured (mm) to examine if shrinkage occurs. Tail feathers will then be sent to the Rocky Mountain Center for Conservation Genetics and Systematics to determine gender using molecular methods.  Verification Using Molecular TechniquesGriffiths et al. (1998) designed primers around homologous regions in the chromo-helicase-DNA-binding (CHD) gene on sex chromosomes W and Z in birds. This technique takes advantage of the fact that chromosomes W and Z evolve at different rates.  Homologous regions on sex chromosomes typically are different sizes due to mutations involving insertions and deletions of DNA nucleotides. Their method simultaneously amplifies homologous regions on the W and Z chromosome followed by a restriction digest, which allows for differentiation of males (ZZ  1 band) and females (ZW  2 bands) in many species of birds with the possible exception of Struthioniformes.  Ellegren (1996) developed PCR primers for collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) within the CHD gene that resulted in gender identification of closely related species without the restriction digest step.  Kahn et al. (1998) designed a different set of primers in a more conserved region of the CHD gene that work in most avian species.  This technique has been used to identify gender of many species including mountain plover (Charadrius montanus)  (Dinsmore et al. 2002) using feathers and kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) from feces (Robertson et al. 1999) and has been shown to work well in white-winged doves (S. J. Oyler-McCance and C. E. Braun, unpublished data).DNA will be extracted from all feathers using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification System (Promega) following the manufacturers specifications.  A standard 25 &#61549;l PCR (Quinn 1992) will be performed in a PTC-200 thermal cycler (MJ Research) using the primers developed by Kahn et al. (1998) with the forward primer labeled with a fluorescent dye and the reverse primer unlabeled.  Each reaction will be preheated at 94C for 30 s and then amplified for 35 cycles using the following thermal profile: denaturation, 94C for 2 min; annealing, 56C for 1 min; and extension, 72C for 2 min. Amplified products will be run on the CEQ 8000 Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter) using the Size Standard-400 and the default Frag 3 method.  Males will be identified by a single peak and females by 2 peaks.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Status and Trends: Develop and evaluate inventory and monitoring methods, protocols, experimental designs, analytic tools, models, and technologies to measure biological status and trends.  Our objective is to test use of length of 1 of the 2 central brown tail feathers of white-winged doves to learn if this method can be used to correctly assign gender to live birds. Preliminary work in Arizona (800+ bandings, 40+ recaptures) during 2000-05 indicates there is a difference in tail feather length between males and females of all age classes (AHY, SY, HY) although sample sizes for SYs and HYs are small. These differences have also been verified on small samples (~ 20 birds) of gonadally checked hunter- harvested white-winged doves in Arizona. The hypothesis is that central tail feather length (mm) is correlated with gender and can be used to reliably assign gender to live or dead white-winged doves.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Comparison of Trumpeter Swan Populations Using Nuclear and Mitochondrial Genetic Markers\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Historically, trumpeter swans were abundant throughout most of North America, ranging from AK to the Gulf of Mexico and east to Hudsons Bay. Habitat destruction and over-harvest led to the significant reduction of the species. In the coterminous U.S., only 1 group of trumpeter swans survived overexploitation likely due to their remote location (MT, ID, and WY [i.e., the Tri-state region]) near what is now Red Rock Lakes NWR.  Until the mid-1900s, when trumpeter swans were found nesting in Canada and AK, these birds (subsequently termed Tri-state birds) were believed to be the only remaining free-ranging trumpeters.  Following the discovery of the additional birds and assessment of band-recovery information, the swans were delineated into populations largely along administrative boundaries.  The Pacific Population (PP) is comprised of birds nesting primarily in AK and western portions of the Yukon Territory and British Columbia.  The Rocky Mountain Population (RMP) consists of birds comprising 2 flocks, the Tri-state birds mentioned above and another group that nests in the Grande Prairie-Peace River region of Alberta.  Additionally, attempts to restore nesting trumpeters to formerly occupied range have occurred since the late 1930s.  Translocations of birds and eggs from the RMP resulted in the establishment of nesting flocks at Ruby Lake, NV and Malheur NWR in OR.  Those flocks currently are included in the RMP for management purposes.  Restoration efforts also resulted in the establishment of the Interior Population (IP), which is comprised of two major groups.  Birds inhabiting the midwest were derived primarily from the translocation of swan eggs from AK (PP).  In contrast, the High Plains flock of the IP was established by translocating primarily Tri-state (RMP) birds and eggs to SD.  Wintering swans also have been translocated from the Tri-state area (RMP) to UT, OR, WY, and areas of ID outside the Tri-state region in an attempt to establish migratory routes for the Tri-state flock and to relieve pressure on that habitat that has become saturated by RMP swans migrating south from Alberta.  Despite terming these different populations the distinctions are based largely on political boundaries and may not represent biological differences among groups.Much controversy surrounds the management of the RMP.  Although the 2 flocks comprising this population are spatially disjunct during the nesting season, they are sympatric during winter in the Tri-state region.  The population as a whole has been increasing (6% per year) since 1975.  However, most of the growth has occurred in the Canadian flock; the size of the Tri-state flock has remained low.  The existence or extent of genetic interchange between these 2 groups remains unknown, yet may influence management practices and whether the flocks should be managed in the aggregate or as 2 distinct entities.  Further, the amount of genetic distinctness among trumpeter swans rangewide is an important parameter to understand given the increasingly complex level and patterns of restoration efforts that often involve translocations of swans and of swan eggs. The distribution of genetic variation among populations across the range remains unclear.  With increasing pressure on managers to make difficult decisions about whether populations are unique or not, and which populations to use as sources for translocation and restoration attempts, resolution of this issue has become vital. It is likely that a fine scale study of genetic polymorphisms would provide this needed information, particularly if done using significant sample numbers from the most relevant populations.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We propose to obtain samples from at least three groups of trumpeter swans (PP, Tri-state, and Canadian flocks of the RMP).  Samples from other locales may be of interest with the understanding that such populations have been reconstructed using individuals introduced from these three groups.  We are currently conducting a pilot study to determine which tissue type would be best for sampling both from a genetic standpoint (getting adequate DNA) and from a field collection standpoint (something that is feasible to collect in the field).  Our current options for tissue types are feathers, blood, eggs, and web clips.  We are hoping that clipping a small portion of the swans webbing will provide a good DNA sample and have a minimal impact on the bird.  All sampling will be done by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service personnel.  1) Sampling of tissue for DNA extraction and PCR procedures:  Blood, tissue, feathers, or eggs can each serve as a tissue source for PCR-based amplification and sequencing from a single bird (see for example, Kahn et al., 1998).  Approximately 20-30 individuals (preferably adults) will be sampled from each locale.  DNA will be extracted using either a standard phenol/chloroform method or a manufactured kit protocol both which have been used successfully in previous work in Quinn's laboratory and by Oyler-McCance.2) Mitochondrial DNA sequencing:  PCR will be used to amplify and sequence a highly variable portion of the mitochondrial control region, following the procedures of Quinn (1992).  Other rapidly evolving regions in the mitochondrial genome might also be investigated in this study.  Precautions to detect and circumvent possible technical problems associated with nuclear homologues of mitochondrial sequences will be implemented as described by Quinn and White (1987), Quinn (1992), Quinn (1997) and Sorenson and Quinn (1998).3) Nuclear microsatellite genotyping:  The same populations will be used to study the distribution of several polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci.  This  information is expected to augment the mitochondrial data set in a synergistic fashion.  The techniques used by Oyler-McCance et al. (1999) will be applied, using DNA extracted during the mitochondrial study.  The development of 5-10 microsatellite primer pairs will be done following the techniques that have successfully been applied in other studies within Quinns lab, of sage grouse (Taylor, 2001) and of Leopard frogs (Benedict, 2001).  These methods are based on a magnetic \"hybrid-capture enrichment\" procedure initially described by Nyakaana and Arctander (1998). 4) Data analysis:  The nuclear and mitochondrial data collected for this study would be amenable to a variety of analyses, including methods that employ allele frequency data (e.g. FST (Wright, 1951), GST (Nei, 1973 and Takahata and Palumbi, 1985), private alleles (Slatkin, 1985)), methods that take advantage of character-state or geographic information (Slatkin and Maddison 1989, Swofford 1993, Neigel et al. 1991, Excoffier et al. 1992), and methods that estimate genetic distances between populations (Nei 1987) or haplotypes (Saitou and Nei 1987). These and related approaches provide quantitative estimates of how genetic variation is partitioned among populations and haplotypes, allowing inferences concerning patterns of gene flow, effective population sizes, and evolutionary history to be made.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial - Evaluate the status of plant and animal species at risk and provide scientific guidance for their conservation and management.The objective of this study is to address the following question.  Are there genetic differences among some of the different sample locales that would justify their treatment as discrete biological populations?  While not the direct focus of this study, it is worth noting that the data collected to compare levels of genetic differentiation among populations will also provide a direct measure of population genetic variation.  This is important because low levels of genetic variation have been linked to reduced fitness (OBrien and Evermann 1988, Quattro and Vrijenhoek 1989, Wayne et al. 1991) in some species and may have a negative effect on (for example) Tri-state swans now or in the future. These data may also have additional uses.  If mitochondrial sequence differences are documented among different populations, we may be able to: (1) study migration patterns and routes, and (2) identify the breeding-ground origin of birds sampled on migration or wintering areas.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Data from both nuclear and mitochondiral markers revealed a significant difference between the Pacific Coast Population and the Rocky Mountain Population with the Yukon Territory as a likely area of overlap. Additionally, we found that the two populations have somewhat similar levels of genetic diversity (Pacific Coast Population is slightly higher) suggesting that the Pacific Coast Population underwent a population bottleneck similar to a well-documented one in the Rocky Mountain Population. Both genetic structure and diversity results reveal that the Tri-State flock, a suspected unique, non-migratory flock, is not genetically different from the Canadian flock of the Rocky Mountian Population and need not be treated as a unique population from a genetic standpoint.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Genetics/Genomics of Lesser Prairie-Chicken\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Conservation concern for the Lesser Prairie-Chicken dates back to the Dust Bowl era, when the species was thought to be extinct after a decade of catastrophic habitat conditions.  The current distribution is approximately 16% of the estimated historical range at the time of European settlement, a decline that resulted in its recent listing as a threatened species under the United States Endangered Species Act. In addition to range contraction, agricultural and urban development has divided the geographic range into at least two widely separated regional populations. The Lesser Prairie-Chicken currently persists in four ecoregions distributed among five states in the central United States including:  1) a mosaic of Shortgrass Prairie intermixed with land enrolled in the CRP in northwestern Kansas; 2) Sand Sagebrush Prairie in eastern Colorado, western Kansas and northwestern Oklahoma; 3) Mixed Grass Prairies in south-central Kansas, the Oklahoma panhandle, and the northeastern Texas panhandle; and 4) Shinnery Oak Prairie of eastern New Mexico and the western Texas panhandle.  The primary threats to the Lesser Prairie-Chicken are habitat loss and fragmentation that result from anthropogenic land uses, such as conversion of grassland habitat for agriculture, encroachment of eastern red cedar due to fire suppression, and energy development, that are incompatible with the species life-history. It is unclear how the species demography and genetic diversity have been affected by such changes to the landscape. The effects of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity have been well-documented in other grouse. Several isolated or peripheral populations of Lesser Prairie-Chickens have been documented to have lower genetic diversity than in continuous populations.  To date, regional scale studies based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) suggest relatively high levels of genetic connectivity across the species range, yet such patterns likely represent historical rather than current connectivity.The Lesser Prairie-Chicken, like other prairie grouse, possesses a lek breeding behavior with high variance in male mating success. Species with highly skewed mating systems typically have reduced effective population sizes (Ne) compared to census size because a high proportion of males do not reproduce, thereby increasing the loss of overall genetic diversity due to genetic drift when populations are small. Reduced population connectivity and a subsequent decline in Ne in the Greater Prairie-Chicken led to increased genetic drift and inbreeding depression, manifested by reduced hatching success  and reduced diversity among immune-related genes. As such, documenting and monitoring levels of Ne is an important tool for the conservation and management of Lesser Prairie-Chicken.The Lesser Prairie-Chicken rangewide population trends remain precarious. However, recent responses to changes in available habitat both inspire optimism yet raise additional concerns.  Portions of the historical range in Kansas were recently reoccupied by Lesser Prairie-Chickens, and the distribution in northwestern Kansas now extends beyond the species known historic range. The current range shifts have coincided with the planting and maintenance of CRP fields that provide the necessary vegetation structure for Lesser Prairie-Chicken throughout the shortgrass prairies.  Population trends in this region have increased with changes in distribution, yet the source populations involved in the range expansion are not known.  Moreover, the range expansion has resulted in geographic overlap between Lesser and Greater Prairie-Chickens, increasing the potential for hybridization, genetic introgression, and conservation status complications.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We obtained Lesser Prairie-Chicken samples from 28 counties throughout its current geographic distribution. Most samples were obtained from blood or plucked feathers taken from individuals captured in passive funnel traps.In addition, feather samples were collected non-invasively from geographic areas where blood samples were lacking. To investigate hybridization, we also sampled areas in northwestern Kansas (Gove, Ness, and Trego Counties), where the Lesser and Greater Prairie-Chickens are sympatric. A total of 49 Lesser and 28 Greater Prairie-Chickens were sampled in this area, as well as six putative hybrids based on morphology and behavior and seven individuals that were possible hybrids based on morphology, yet not verified by vocalization. We also obtained samples from 20 Greater Prairie-Chickens collected in east Kansas (Wabaunsee County; Johnson et al. 2003), over 300 km from the closest Lesser Prairie-Chicken population, to verify that the method can identify the two species as distinct clusters.  Samples were amplified across 13 microsatellite loci. PCR products were loaded and were run on an AB3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Allele sizes were determined for each locus using GeneMapper v4.1 software (Applied Biosystems).\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial - Evaluate the status of plant and animal species at risk and provide scientific guidance for their conservation and management.Fewer genetic studies have focused on the Lesser Prairie-Chicken relative to the Greater Prairie-Chicken or both species of sage-grouse.  Therefore, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on population structure, population connectivity, and genetic diversity remain largely unknown. Our goal in this study was to characterize the genetic structure and gene flow throughout the species geographic distribution to identify potential threats to population viability and aid conservation management. Specifically, our objectives at the range-wide scale were to 1) characterize patterns of connectivity, 2) document levels of genetic variability among populations, 3) identify the source population(s) for the region of recent range expansion, and 4) determine the level of introgression with the Greater Prairie-Chicken in areas where the two species overlap in distribution.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings We identified three or four distinct populations corresponding largely to ecoregions. The Shinnery Oak Prairie and Sand Sagebrush Prairie represented distinct populations (FST >0.034 and FST > 0.023 respectively).  The Shortgrass/CRP Mosaic and Mixed Grass ecoregions appeared admixed (FST < 0.009). Genetic diversity was similar among ecoregions and Ne ranged from 142 for the Shortgrass/CRP Mosaic to 296 in the Mixed Grass Prairie.  No recent migration was detected among ecoregions, except from the Mixed Grass Prairie north into the Shortgrass/CRP Mosaic (m = 0.207, 95% CI = 0.116 - 0.298). STRUCTURE analysis investigating potential hybridization revealed K = 2 corresponding to the two species. Several hybrids and pure individuals were admixed suggesting hybridization. Asymmetric migration rates confirm that both Lesser and Greater Prairie-Chicken in the Shortgrass/CRP were the source of the hybrid group. Continued monitoring of diversity within and among ecoregions is warranted as are actions promoting genetic connectivity and range expansion.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Evaluation of genetic, behavioral and morphological distinctness of Greater Sage Grouse in the Bi-State Planning Area\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Prior research into genetic diversity, gene flow and evolutionary history identified high levels of unique mitochondrial haplotypes in Greater Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in southwestern Nevada and eastern California known as the Bi-State Sage Grouse Planning Area (Benedict et al. 2003).  Nuclear DNA markers, investigated by Sonja Taylor (2001), and mitochondrial DNA markers investigated by Benedict et al. (2003) both provide evidence that lack of gene flow and genetic drift may be operating in Mono (CA) and Lyon (NV) counties.  A more recent investigation of population genetics for greater sage-grouse across their range offers strong evidence to suggest that grouse in the Mono/Lyon county areas of Nevada and California are indeed genetically distinct and warrant protection and management as a separate unit (Oyler-McCance et al. 2005).  Geographic isolation is the apparent facilitating mechanism for this genetic drift, and available evidence suggests genetic bottlenecks within these populations have not occurred in recent history (Oyler-McCance et al. 2005,Taylor 2001).\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will determine the mtDNA haplotye and the genotypes over 9 previously described microsatellites for each individual sampled.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial - Evaluate the status of plant and animal species at risk and provide scientific guidance for their conservation and management.The goal of this research is to characterize the level of uniqueness of greater sage grouse in the Bi-State Planning Area and to delineate the geographic extent of any existing genetic distinctiveness.  We will also attempt to estimate the amount of time that the the Bi-state has been isoated.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings In this study we are further characterizing a unique population of Sage Grouse, located in Lyon County, Nevada and the Mono Basin, in California. This population was formerly determined to be genetically different from other Greater Sage Grouse Populations across the Rocky Mountain Region of North America.  Previous genetic work focused on comparing all populations across the species range. We identified whether subpopulations within the Bi-state carried the unique Lyon/Mono mtDNA haplotypes and compared those data to neighboring populations. We also evaluated genetic structure among subpopulations within the Bi-State using both mtDNA haplotypes and microsatellites. We sampled eight subpopulations within the Bi-State and used samples previously collected from two neighboring populations.  Eight haplotypes were found exclusively in the Bi-State population and represented 74% of individuals, while three haplotypes were shared with neighboring populations. Genetic diversity was lowest in Parker Meadows.  White Mountains (WM) and Pine Nuts (PN) were the most differentiated, yet all subpopulations were significantly different from the neighboring populations. The PN subpopulation contains individuals carrying the Bi-state signature and also individuals that are a mix of Lassen and Bi-state.  It is the northernmost subpopulation and represents the boundary of the Bi-state area.   Management actions that promote genetic connectivity, especially with respect to WM and PN, may be critical to the long-term viability of the Bi-State population. Our genomic analysis of the Bi-state, the Greater Sage-grouse, and the Gunnison Sage-grouse revealed that pairwise multilocus FST was high (0.417) between Gunnison Sage-grouse and Greater Sage-grouse, and both principle coordinates analysis and model-based clustering grouped samples unequivocally by species. Standing genetic variation was lower within the Gunnison Sage-grouse, consistent with previous work. The Bi-state population was also significantly differentiated from Greater Sage-grouse, albeit much more weakly (FST =0.041), and genetic clustering results were consistent with reduced gene flow between two intraspecific groups. No comparable genetic divisions were found within the Greater Sage-grouse sample, which spanned the southern half of the range. The chromosomal location of a subset of SNPs was inferred by alignment to the chicken genome, revealing an excess of high FST SNPs on the Z chromosome that differentiate Gunnison Sage-grouse from Greater Sage-grouse. Fast evolution of the Z in the Gunnison Sage-grouse lineage was further indicated by low diversity at Z-linked SNPs relative to autosomal SNPs in those samples only. Our genomic analysis clarifies patterns of genetic variation in Sage-grouse and suggests mechanisms underlying speciation.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) within the Bi-State Management Zone (area along the border between Nevada and California) are geographically isolated on the southwestern edge of the species range. Previous research demonstrated that this population is genetically unique compared to other populations across the species range. As a result, this population was considered a Distinct Population Segment (DPS) and was preliminarily ruled as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The goal of our study was to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the boundaries of this genetically unique population (where the Bi-State population begins) and to examine the genetic structure within the Bi-State, which is needed to help guide effective management decisions. Our genetic data supports the idea that the Bi-State DPS represents a genetically unique population and identified the Pine Nut Mountains to be the northern boundary of the Bi-State population.  We also found three distinct subpopulations (southern Pine Nut Mountains, mid Bi-State, and White Mountains) within the Bi-State that would benefit from conservation and management actions. This information could be used by managers to develop conservation strategies for the Bi-State that might include population augmentation, preventing future habitat loss and fragmentation, enhancing existing habitat, protecting and maintain connectivity among and within subpopulations (through reduction of conifers to promote sage-brush dominate corridors), and monitoring genetic diversity.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Population Structure and Dynamics of the Midget Faded Rattlesnake, Crotalus viridis concolor, with the use of Telemetry and Microsatellite DNA Markers\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Crotalus viridis concolor (Midget Faded Rattlesnake) is a dwarfed subspecies of the prairie rattlesnake, C.v. viridis.  Midget Faded Rattlesnakes range from southwestern Wyoming, eastern Utah, and western Colorado.  Their range in southwestern Wyoming is restricted to an isolated area of the lower Green River valley from the cities of Green River and Rock Springs to the Wyoming/Utah state border (Baxter and Stone, 1980, see Fig. 1).  Very little is known about Midget Faded Rattlesnake ecology, and although little is known of their population status, they are considered rare throughout their range (Baxter and Stone, 1980).  Midget Faded Rattlesnakes exist in very small isolated groups focused around den sites which can include between 1 and ~25 individuals (Ashton and Patton, pers. comm.).  (Various investigators suspect that Midget Faded Rattlesnakes actually exist as a classic metapopulation.)  This is very different from C.v.v., which can involve hundreds at a single den sites.  Another marked difference between the two conspecifics is in their seasonal movements.  C.v.v. have been known to travel many kilometers in a season, while Midget Faded Rattlesnakes may only travel a few hundred meters (Kyle Ashton, University of Colorado, Boulder, pers. comm.).  C.v.v. have been shown to reproduce biennially and usually not before their fourth year, particularly in the northern parts of their range (Klauber 1997).  Limited evidence suggest the same for Midget Faded Rattlesnakes(Ashton, pers. comm.).  Such natural history traits make Midget Faded Rattlesnakes a sensitive species vulnerable to various human impacts (collection, development, recreation, etc.).Causing further complications for C.v.c. in this part of their range is the Flaming Gorge Reservoir.  The construction of the dam and the filling of the Flaming Gorge Reservoir almost fifty years ago, divided the population in half and forced them to higher ground.  This virtually prevents gene flow between the two sides of the reservoir.  So this may have presented both spatial and genetic consequences for the population.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Samples will be collected from the Crotalis viridis concolor populations around the Flaming Gorge Reservoir in southern Sweetwater County, Wyoming.  We will survey subpopulations and uniquely mark all Crotalis viridis concolor encountered by scale-clipping (Brown and Parker 1976).  Marking will serve two functions.  The first will allow us to identify rattlesnakes later for movement data.  Second, enough genetic material can be collected from the scales that are removed for genetic analysis.  We will attempt to capture approximately 20 individuals from each of 8 populations.  Scale clips will be removed and blood will be drawn. DNA will be extracted from scale clips following Rodriquez-Robles et al. (1999) or blood following the standard phenol chloroform protocl.  We will sequence various regions of the mitochondrial genome specifically the control region, the ND 2 region, and the APTase 8 region.  We will also screen microsatellites using primers developed for the Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake (Gibbs et al. 1998) and the Timber Rattlesnake (Villarreal et al. 1996).  If the previously described microsatellites cannot be used for this study (no amplification or insufficient polymorphism), we will attempt to isolate microsatellites from Pygmy Faded Rattlesnakes following Hamilton et al. (In review) which is based on Armour et al. (1994) and Loew (1995).\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Population Genetic Analysis of Mountain Plover\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem A genetic study of four populations of mountain plover  (Quinn and Oyler-McCance, unpublished report) has shown that although mountain plover habitat has been lost and fragmented, gene flow among isolated populations has been sufficient to prevent genetic differentiation among populations.  This study used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data to make inferences about population structure. While mtDNA has its advantages (its mutation rate, on average, is much higher than the nuclear genome and different regions in the genome mutate at different rates allowing for investigation of variation at different scales), a potential limitation is its maternal mode of inheritance, which means that mtDNA tracks only female movement.       Given the lack of differentiation of the mitochondrial genome, nuclear markers may show a similar pattern of genetic subdivision (that is, lack thereof), as there is no indication that males and females have different patterns of dispersal (Knopf 1996).   Nonetheless, a more complete picture of gene flow that also reflects the contribution of males would be obtained by adding information from nuclear markers.  In addition, nuclear microsatellites would also be useful for paternity studies, an area of research that would be particularly interesting in this species, as females can double-clutch, leaving the first male incubating that first clutch, and potentially mating with a second male to produce the second clutch (Graul 1973).\n",
      "\t\tMethodology DNA has previously been extracted from all mountain plover samples.  Microsatellites will be isolated using the unpublished protocol of St. John and Quinn.  Once the microsatellites are isolated, primers will be designed which flank the repetitive microsatellite and optimized.

We speculate that the lack of detectable genetic differentiation among populations, despite their geographic isolation and fidelity to breeding locations, is due to sufficient gene flow among breeding populations. Such gene flow might ensue if at least some pair bonds are formed when birds from across the breeding grounds occur in mixed flocks on wintering grounds. This study corroborates findings and conclusions of an earlier study of mitochondrial DNA population structure of Mountain Plover.Additional work using genomic markers (SNPs) aims to be able to differentiate the breeding location of birds sampled on the wintering grounds.  We have developed a set of SNPs that are diagnostic to the breeding grounds and are now testing their efficacy.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments We have shown using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers that contrary to previous assertions, there appears to be little genetic differentiation among breeding populations of mountain plover.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Investigation of white-tailed kite population bottleneck using museum specimens\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In conservation biology, understanding the temporal and geographic population fluctuations of a species, and the causes for these changes, are critical in the development of long-term management strategies for the preservation of the species.  Information on population trends of a species through time, as well as the underlying causes for these trends, e.g., habitat loss and alteration, human persecution, emigration and immigration, are critical in assessing and prioritizing its conservation needs in the future.The white-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus) is one such raptor species that has demonstrated large population fluctuations over the last 150 years.  White-tailed kite populations in North America have undergone dramatic fluctuations since early records of the species from the mid 1800s.  Common in the early expeditions of the western U.S., by the turn of the century naturalists noted that white-tailed kites were rare and suspected that the species was close to extinction.  By the 1930s, the species was extirpated in the southeastern U.S. and was considered nearly extinct in California.  But kite numbers began to increase in the 1920-30s and by the 1940s, a trend towards recovery was apparent as increasing numbers were observed in subsequent decades. 1980).  Today, the white-tailed kite is a fairly common resident in California, with slowly increasing numbers in Texas, Florida, and Oregon, and in the middle Americas.  However, populations in some areas fluctuate considerably and have recently declined in others.Although there may be a number of underlying reasons for the rapid population changes in white-tailed kites, the main causes are believed to be impacts of land use practices and habitat changes on prey availability and habitat suitability.  Dramatic alterations in marshland and adjacent habitats used by kites have occurred since European settlement of the U.S., which may have affected the rodent prey populations this species is dependent upon.  Stendell noted the dependence of kite populations in the Sacramento River delta and adjacent marsh areas of California on the California vole (Microtus californicus).  Changes in habitat and agricultural practices, in addition to the introduction of non-native rodent species such as the House Mouse (Mus musculus) may have affected kite population trends.  Population fluctuations observed in kite numbers may reflect these changes in prey abundance and habitat availability.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology To address the project objectives we are using a population genetic approach to determine both the historic and current genetic relationships of populations of white-tailed kites in the U.S. We have obtained museum specimens from before the population bottleneck and have also collected post bottleneck blood samples.  We will use microsatellite analysis to characterize both pre and post bottleneck populations.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Status and Trends of Biological Resources - Develop and evaluate methods, protocols, experimental design, analytic tools, models, and technologies to measure biological status and trends.The objectives of this project are:To determine the genetics of current and historic white-tailed kite populations to address: a) whether North American white-tailed kite populations were actually extirpated in the 1920s; b) and if so, determine where current kite populations originated from; and c) determine whether kite populations suffer a genetic bottleneck during the near extirpation in the 1920s.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Primary users of the information will be USDI resource and land management agencies, other Federal agencies, state and local governments, universities, and non-governmental organizations, in particular California Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, and Western Regional Office of USGS Biological Resources Division.The main product of this project will be a cost- and time-efficient incorporation of population monitoring data (both present and past) with laboratory technologies for assessing current and historic trophic relationships and population genetics of avian species of concern.  Further refinement of these techniques, and increased collaboration with ongoing field studies, may increase the scope of such population analyses and reduce the time and costs of intensive field collection.  Once these techniques and costs are streamlined, other avian species in critical population decline may be analyzed in similar fashion.  A review paper highlighting the advantages of this general approach and its application to other avian species will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal; data generated from this study will be made accessible through the NBII.  Presentations, journal publications, and a final report to cooperators/partners (e.g., USGS, FWS, California Dept. of Fish and Game) will be made available for consideration of incorporating these techniques into their resource management programs.  Most importantly, support for this project will increase the research capabilities of the USGS and give field researchers an additional tool for addressing questions in population ecology and management.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Population genetics of wood frogs in Rocky Mountain National Park\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Wood frog (Rana sylvatica) populations in Colorado and Wyoming represent a group of frogs disjunct from other wood frog populations in North America. The wood frog was listed by the State of Colorado as a threatened species until recent, intensive surveys revealed that wood frogs appear to be holding their own in the State (Corn et al. 1989). A number of factors potentially threaten wood frog populations in Colorado including loss of habitat as more development occurs in relatively pristine areas, pollution, and effects from wildland fires and timber sales. Disease may also threaten wood frogs. This species was diagnosed recently with chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) in Rocky Mountain National Park (Rittmann et al. in press). Wood frogs represent the only remaining ranid frog in Rocky Mountain National Park (Corn et al.1997). They are restricted to the west side of the Park in a valley where the Colorado River flows as a small stream. The aim of this proposal is to examine the local demographics of the wood frog populations in the valley and determine if the individuals form one metapopulation or if genetically distinguishable populations exist. Although Newman and Squire (2001) found similar allele frequencies among wood frog populations in the Prairie Pothole region, we suspect that we will find some differences in genetic structure in the valley. First, beaver and beaver ponds were formerly an important aspect of the Kawunechee valley landscape. This impact was reduced during beaver harvesting in the 1800s and now beaver-modified landscapes, generally friendly to amphibians, have reverted to pre-beaver landscapes, possibly leaving barriers to amphibian dispersal. Second, Rana sylvatica exhibits a high degree of philopatry (Berven and Grudzien 1990), suggesting that there may be genetic differentiation among breeding ponds or complexes of ponds. An examination of the genetic structure of these groups of wood frogs may shed light on issues of disease transmission and infection rate.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Genetic techniques provide the potential to examine relative rates of dispersal and genetic relatedness for such a (meta)population (Slatkin 1995). We plan to address such questions with information from microsatellite analysis - a technique that has been used successfully with wood frogs and to address small-scale population questions (Newman and Squire. 2001, 2002). We will use microsatellite primers previously developed for wood frogs (Newman and Squire. 2001, 2002) to examine genetic variation at 4  6 microsatellite loci within the Rana sylvatica genome. This information will allow us to compare genetic information among the pond complexes in the Kawuneeche Valley and make a determination of relatedness (and habitat connectedness) throughout the valley. 7 samples will be collected from each of 5 selected sites (either tissue samples collected from tadpoles from obviously different clutches (tail clip) or 5-10 eggs will be collected from different clutches). Sites will be selected to spatially represent known areas of wood frog presence in the Kawuneeche Valley. Selection will be based on our surveys in Rocky Mountain National Park (Muths, Muths and Scherer unpublished data 2000, 2002, 2003). Sampling will be coincident with capture  recapture work at one complex of sites and will be opportunistic at other sites. All sampling will occur during the breeding season when frogs are most obvious.Tissue will be collected in ethanol, labeled appropriately and delivered to the Center for Conservation Genetics and Systematics within one week of collection. DNA will be extracted using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification System (Promega) following manufacturers specifications.  Microsatellite alleles will be amplified using a standard 25 &#61549;l PCR (Quinn 1992) for each locus using a dye-labeled forward primer and an unlabeled reverse primer. Amplified products will be visualized using the CEQ2000 XL DNA Analysis System (Beckman-Coulter). The data collected for this study would be amenable to a variety of analyses, including methods that employ allele frequency data (e.g. FST (Wright, 1951), GST (Nei, 1973 and Takahata and Palumbi, 1985), private alleles (Slatkin, 1985)), and methods that estimate genetic distances between populations (Nei 1987). These and related approaches provide quantitative estimates of how genetic variation is partitioned among populations, allowing inferences concerning patterns of gene flow, effective population sizes, and evolutionary history to be made.\n",

These activities are covered here under the general task of technical assistance and research program development and include proposal writing, development of partnerships and collaborations, service to national and international scientific societies (including providing scientific peer reviews), providing technical assistance based on scientific expertise developed over the careers of the scientists, manuscript preparation unrelated to defined tasks, performing administrative tasks, and providing guidance and supervision of BRD scientists working under this project.  Ongoing communications between USGS and the various land management, private, and research agencies with which we work will ensure that priority research needs are met in the most effective and efficient manner, and that the resulting information is disseminated to those who will use it.

      "\t\tMethodology We have used DNA sequence data (mitochondrial, chloroplast, and nuclear) along with DNA fragment data from nuclear microsatellites to document the population structure of many spe-cies, including Greater Sage-Grouse, Gunnison Sage-Grouse, Mountain Plover, Lesser Prairie-Chicken, Trumpeter Swan, Midget-Faded Rattlesnake, and Wood Frog.  Information from these projects is being used to redefine taxonomic boundaries, investigate hybrid zones, and define dis-tinct population segment and management units.Our genetic techniques have allowed us to uniquely identify individuals for analysis of mating systems and for mark-recapture analysis to estimate population size. These techniques are cur-rently being used on Gunnison Sage-Grouse, Greater Sage-Grouse, and the Indiana Bat.  As a part of these projects, we are also perfecting the extraction of DNA from low-quantity, non-invasive samples such as feathers and excrement.We are currently involved in a project on ancient tea trees in the Yunnan Province in China.  An-cient tea gardens in the Province contain tea trees thousands of years old that have intrinsic value to minority cultures in China.  Our project is an attempt to provide genetic verification of the origin of tea leaves from the ancient tea gardens, which is essential for establishing the market-ability of the ancient teas.  This is important for three reasons:  First, these teas are produced by minority people in China and the sustainability these cultures is highly reliant on traditional agri-cultural practices associated with ancient teas.  Second, it is the policy of the Chinese govern-ment to sustain such minority cultures.  Establishing the marketability of ancient tea supports that policy.  Third, socio-economic conditions of the tea-growing region can be most reliably improved through sale of high-value teas.    Our ancient DNA facility is being used determine the sex of bones from the extinct Hawaiian Giant goose.  Another project conducted in this facility is comparing the genetic make-up of modern populations of White-tailed Kites with ancient samples to determine the extent of a pro-posed genetic bottleneck in the 1930s.We have recently begun to use transposable elements, specifically the chicken repeat 1 (CR1), for systematic studies of waterfowl.

      "\t\tTaskTitle FORT Molecular Ecology Lab\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The use of molecular genetics tools has become increasingly important in addressing conservation issues pertaining to plants and animals. Genetic information can be used to augment studies of population dynamics and population viability, investigate systematics, refine taxonomic definitions, investigate population structure and gene flow, and document genetic diversity in a variety of plant and animal species. Further, genetic techniques are being used to investigate mating systems through paternity analysis, analyze ancient DNA samples from museum specimens, and estimate population size and survival rates using DNA as a unique marker.  In addition to these more traditional uses of genetic information, molecular genetics is increasingly being used to investigate the structure, function and expression of genes and their response to environmental stressors (e.g., climate change, land cover changes), elucidate how geographical and environmental features structure genetic processes such as gene flow, genetic drift, and selection (landscape genetics), identify, track and make predictions regarding emerging infectious diseases (e.g., white nose syndrome, plague), and monitor and predict the impacts of genetically modified organisms (e.g., genetically modified crops) and contaminants on wildlife and ecosystems.  Such information is essential for the sound management of species, populations, and sometimes even individuals, as well as for the development of long-term management strategies and regulatory decisions by agencies within the Department of the Interior, as well as other land and resource management agencies.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The Rocky Mountain Center for Conservation Genetics and Systematics was established in 2003 as a cooperative partnership between the Fort Collins Science Center and the University of Denver, Department of Biology.  The Center provided both a research and academic learning environment and is dedicated to the application and advancement of genetic theory and techniques to address conservation issues pertaining to plants and animals, particularly those needs within the interior U.S.  USGS and DU shared Co-directorship of the Center with USGS taking the predominant role in terms of research conducted at the Center as well as day-to-day operations of the lab.  In addition to the two DU and USGS Co-Directors, the center provided opportunities for shorter-term researchers consisting of a mix of visiting scientists, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduate students.  In 2010, because of diverging interests, new USGS opportunities, and upcoming space reallocation at DU (leading to subsequent downsizing of the current laboratory space), the FORT relocated it molecular genetics capabilities inhouse at the FORT.  This relocation is more suitable to our mission, provides greater stability over the long-term, and offers more opportunities for growth, both in terms of science directions and also personnel, as well as enhanced collaboration with current and new partners.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial - Evaluate the status of plant and animal species at risk and provide scientific guidance for their conservation and management.1) gather information on species composition and population dynamics through comparisons of genetic components, and develop new, efficient methods for applying such techniques to species management;2) incorporate genetic components in population viability assessment (PVA) models, MARK program, and other statistical and modeling methodologies, and help develop genetics as a key component to ecosystems/biocomplexity research and modeling in the future;3) directly apply population genetics to the study of species and habitats of federal concern, particularly in terms of the preservation of genetic diversity of populations and  species, and the biodiversity of threatened ecosystems;4) gather information on the genetics of a species and its populations in relation to impacts on specific litigation and policy questions reflecting the management of a species, which may in turn have impacts on local economies, hunting regulations, tourism, land use, and the environmental issues;5) further assist in the development of integrated research and management within the USGS by incorporating genetic and molecular tools into current and future research; and6) incorporate genetic and molecular tools into international research issues as ecosystems become more diminished and the economic reliance on these dwindling natural resources, as well as the challenge of preserving them, become more critical in the future.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Examination of the biology of summer roosting Indiana bats using genetic tools\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) was listed as an endangered species in 1967 with full legal protection provided by the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  Despite protection, the rangewide population has declined by approximately half since listing; the decline has been particularly steep in the southern portion of the range.   Declines are likely the result of multiple factors including modification and disturbance of hibernacula, loss of summer habitat, and impacts of pesticides.  Although many factors have been identified as potentially contributing to these declines, virtually no information is available about population demographics, with most research having been dedicated to habitat use and selection particularly on the summer range.  Despite the fact that the Indiana bat has been more intensively studied throughout its range than most other North American bats, managers continue to lack basic information about population dynamics on the summer range.  This lack of information is primarily a result of limitations associated with traditional techniques that do not provide researchers with the ability to regularly monitor individual bats throughout a field season. Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques have made it possible to uniquely identify animals using DNA as an individual mark.  DNA samples can now be obtained non-invasively as DNA has been successfully extracted from hair, feathers, feces, and even frozen urine.  Mark-recapture methods using DNA as an individual mark have been used successfully to estimate population sizes of humpback whales, mountain lions, coyotes, and Pyrenean brown bears.   Preliminary work has shown that DNA can be successfully extracted from Indiana bat fecal pellets that were collected from underneath roost trees.  Further, a suite of highly polymorphic microsatellite loci has been isolated from Indiana bat and used to genotype individual Indiana bats.  DNA extraction from bat feces collected in the field has not previously been done nor have markers for Indiana bats been developed.  The optimization and success of these techniques now makes it possible to explore the relatedness of Indiana bat maternity colonies and also attempt to estimate population sizes using DNA non-invasively collected through bat fecal pellets. Because the need for accurate demographic and relatedness information is great for the management and recovery of the Indiana bat, we propose to use the aforementioned techniques to uniquely identify individual bats for the purpose of investigating genetic relatedness and for attempting a trial mark-recapture study to estimate population size.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Field TechniquesCollection of fecal pellets. We will target three primary roost trees in the study site.  We will place a guano trap (similar to those described in Murray and Kurta 2002) under each roost and collect fecal pellets.  Each individual pellet will be placed into a sterile Eppendorf tube using a toothpick to prevent cross contamination of samples and frozen immediately.  Guano from these traps will be collected twice or three times during the summer and frozen for preservation.  Additional samples may be collected and stored for future analyses.  Samples will be shipped frozen to the RMCCGS in Denver, Colorado for analysis.  Molecular Techniques Uniquely identifying individual Indiana bats requires the use of a suite of highly polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers so that individuals can be fingerprinted.  Microsatellites developed for a variety of bat species (Nyctalus noctula, Petri et al.1997; Plecotus auritus, Burland et al. 1998; Myotis myotis, Castella and Ruedi 2000; Miniopterus schreibersii, Miller-Butterworth et al. 2002; Eptesicus fuscus, Vonhof et al. 2002) have been tested on Indiana bats with moderate success.  Additionally, 14 highly polymorphic microsatellites have been isolated from Indiana bat using the protocol developed by St. John and Quinn as described in Oyler-McCance et al. (2005).  Thus, uniquely identifying Indiana bats is possible using our optimized techniques and newly isolated markers. DNA will be extracted from individual fecal pellets using a Extractmaster Fecal DNA Extraction kit (Epicenter).  This extraction technique has been optimized by modifying the manufacturers specifications by allowing the pellets to rehydrate and also resuspending the DNA in 50ul of DNA rehydration buffer instead of 300ul.  Because the DNA extracted from bat fecal pellets is extremely low in concentration, we will employ the pre-amplification method developed by Piggott et al. (2004) that involves a two-step PCR with the aim of increasing the quality and quantity of the desired DNA template and also improving accuracy.  Briefly, this method requires an initial PCR using a pool of primer pairs (6-8) in very low concentration and low stringency reaction conditions.  The resulting product is then used as the template in subsequent PCRs with each primer pair being used in separate reactions under more stringent conditions. DNA extracted from each individual pellet will be genotyped using our newly developed microsatellite primers in a standard 25 &#61549;l PCR (Quinn 1992) performed in a PTC-200 thermal cycler (MJ Research).  For each polymorphic microsatellite locus, a dye-labeled forward primer and an unlabeled reverse primer will be used.  Amplified products will be run on the CEQ 8000 Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter) using the Size Standard-400 and the default Frag 3 method.Data AnalysisIndividual test samples will be genotyped across a suite of polymorphic microsatellite loci.  We will test for linkage disequilibrium for each pair of loci in each population in GENEPOP.  We will evaluate whether individuals are being uniquely identified using a probability of identity estimator (Waits et al. 2001), which can be used as a conservative upper bound for the probability of observing identical genotypes for multiple individuals that may be related.  From those individuals for which we have wing biopsies and fecal pellets, DNA samples will be run blindly and then compared to verify that genotypes match.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Status and Trends of Biological Resources - Develop and evaluate inventory and monitoring methods, protocols, esperimental designs, analytic tools, models, and technologies to measure biological status and trends. 1) Investigate genetic structuring within maternity roosts using DNA collected non-invasively from Indiana bat fecal pellets.  Previous molecular research on the genetic structuring of bat colonies has shown varying degrees of genetic structuring among colonies (Castella et al. 2001).  Migratory species tend to exhibit weak genetic structuring (McCracken et al. 1994, Webb and Tidemann 1996, Wilkinson and Fleming 1996) while nonmigratory species have been shown to be much more structured genetically (Burland et al. 1999, Kerth et al. 2000).  Previous work indicates that Indiana bats exhibit remarkably little genetic variability between hibernating populations (G. McCracken, unpublished data).  Nothing, however, is known about the genetic structure of maternity roosts.  Female Indiana bats return to their natal sites to raise their young (Kurta and Murray 2000).  Mating, conversely, occurs near hibernacula (Humphrey and Cope 1977); and bats from a single maternity roost may later inhabit multiple hibernacula (Kurta and Murray 2000; D.W. Sparks, J.O. Whitaker, and V. Brack, unpublished data).  Groups of bats, however, may migrate from hibernacula to the maternity sites (USFWS 1983; D. W. Sparks and J. O. Whitaker, unpublished data).  These behavioral traits may indicate maternity roosts consist of multiple subgroups of closely related individuals.  Evidence of distinct subunits within maternity colonies of the Indiana bat would provide a theoretical basis to address issues related to recovery of the species such as how new roosts form, and why little genetic structuring is apparent between hibernating populations.   2) Use DNA collected non-invasively to uniquely identify individuals for use in population size estimation of maternity roosts.  By identifying individuals occupying roosts at multiple times, we will attempt to estimate population size using mark-recapture techniques. Further, since the young of the year would not be present (in a fecal sampling) until the final sampling effort, we will attempt to provide an estimate of the young of the year.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan In the early stages of this project, preliminary results will be presented at annual mammal or bat meetings as well as some national conferences (e. g., The Wildlife Society).  In later stages, results will be presented in manuscript form and submitted to peer review journals.   Primary users of the information generated by this research will be land management agencies, federal and state governments, universities, and non-governmental organizations. The current anticipated users of this information will include US Geological Survey, US Fish and Wildlife Service, Indiana State University, University of Denver, and The Rocky Mountain Center for Conservation Genetics and Systematics.

More importantly the products obtained from the molecular research will give the opportunity to integrate research techniques, increase collaboration, and provide new approaches for future research at the USGS.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings We hypothesized that population estimates obtained through genetic mark-recapture would be comparable or higher than emergence counts. In the summer of 2008, we collected fecal pellets at a prominent roost during three time periods each lasting seven or eight days. We genotyped fecal DNA at five highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to uniquely identify individuals and used a robust design mark-recapture approach to estimate detection and survival probabilities as well as population size at the roost. The maximum estimated number of bats present in any single session was 266 in period three.  These bats were composed of adults estimated to be present in prior sampling periods (151, SE=13.34) and juveniles emerging from roosts as well as potential new adults arriving at the roost site (115, SE=31.86).  The number of estimated adults in the third session is similar to the estimated number in the first session (163, SE=11.52) suggesting that there is not a large influx of new adult bats. Moreover, the apparent survival probability of 0.994 (SE=0.04) between primary sampling sessions suggests few bats died or permanently emigrated during the course of the study. Relatedness estimates, r, between all pairs of individuals averaged 0.055 ranging from 0  0.779 suggesting that most individuals were not closely related.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments We demonstrate here the promise of using fecal DNA to estimate demographic information vital to the management of an endangered bat. Further, we offer that such techniques may be widely applicable to other species of bats, particularly those with fission-fusion social dynamics (i.e., the maintenance of stable groups despite recurrent merging and splitting).\n",

A clear example is applying different management strategies to adjacent game management units (GMUs).  If a single population is represented across both GMUs then it is not possible to evaluate either management strategy because the effects are on the population and thus, are confounded across the unit boundaries.Metapopulation structure of cougar populations in California were demonstrated using telemetry and the structure was attributed to small isolated habitat patches created through increased human development.  Further, it has been suggested that a source-sink metapopulation dynamic existed for populations in southern New Mexico cougar populations.  Cougar habitats in southern New Mexico are relatively small and are separated by areas of non-habitat, which is typical for metapopulation structuring of populations for a species that is capable of dispersing across the areas of non-habitat.  However, the high dispersal rates documented in southern New Mexico make it unlikely that any genetic subdivision exists among cougar subpopulations.  The idea of managing cougar populations relative to source-sink areas is also promoted in the Cougar Management Guidelines.  However, this does not specify that source-sink metapopulations exist naturally or if they are artificially created.  In many situations it is likely that the source-sink dynamic is artificially created through hunting pressure in more accessible areas and along the human interface in rural areas to avoid conflict.  Understanding whether the source-sink dynamic is part of a metapopulation or is artificially created within a spatially intact population has important management considerations.  Genetic analysis of cougar populations is one method that has been successfully used to identify population substructures for cougars in California.  In other species, sink areas were artificially created through control efforts and source areas were identified using genetic techniques.Genetic population structure for cougar populations throughout the west, has been evaluated extensively, but generally through the use of microsatellite markers.  In California genetic subdivision of cougar populations was defined and was associated with geographic boundaries and isolation by distance. Others found some genetic substructuring for cougar populations in southern New Mexico and Arizona and similarly attributed this to geographic barriers and distance.  However, genetic substructuring has not been identified across several other western states based on microsatellite markers.  Analysis of microsatellite markers have shown single large panmictic populations for Utah, Southwestern Colorado, Wyoming, and western South Dakota, and northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, Utah, and Colorado. Using an mtDNA analysis, however, actually suggests that the entire North American population is a single homogeneous population coming from a late Pleistocene recolonization.Little analysis of cougar population substructuring has been attempted using mtDNA, which is especially well suited to studying mammal populations with male-biased dispersal. Because mtDNA has the potential to provide an inexpensive method for assessing cougar population substructure across the state of Colorado, it should be evaluated for its efficacy.  Given the evidence against such substructuring across the state using microsatellite markers this should be pursued as a pilot study to first determine if any differences can be detected in mtDNA across the state.  If differences are detected then a more intensive sampling scheme can be used to actually delineate potential subpopulations.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The general hypothesis for this study is that mtDNA and/or nuclear DNA can be used to delineate subpopulations of cougars across the state of Colorado.  Given recent genetic studies using microsatellite markers to investigate substructuring in cougar populations, which included Colorado populations, and documented dispersal distances, we expect limited results from mtDNA as well.  Investigation of mtDNA as a method to investigate the existence of subpopulations within the state is warranted given speculation about source-sink dynamics of cougar populations within Colorado.Tissue or blood samples will be obtained from cougars distributed across all available cougar habitat within the state of Colorado.  Currently, approximately 70 tissue samples have been collected across the state for law enforcement purposes.  About 40 additional tissue or blood samples have been collected along the northern front-range of Colorado and are stored at the Wildlife Health Lab.  The majority of these samples will be used for this study.  Tissue samples have also been collected as part of the Uncompahgre Plateau, cougar research study, which should also be available for analysis.  Starting in 2006 voluntary tooth collection will be initiated for all harvested cougars in the state of Colorado to determine age structures in the harvest.  DNA will be collected from all teeth collected from harvested cougars.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Degradation Rates of DNA Extracted from Fecal Samples for Use with Molecular Markers\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Noninvasive genetic sampling of cougars may prove to be a useful method to estimate population size of cougars across the state, which is something that has not been successfully done using traditional methods.  The use of hair is probably not an effective method for felids because of the amount of shedding, which limits the number of samples that actually produce DNA.  Scats however, should provide a useful method of collecting genetic material as epithelial cells are shed from the intestinal track and appear in the feces.  Important considerations that must be made are the timing of collections and the method of sampling in order to make valid inferences about population size.Defining a sampling scheme for the collection of scats is critical to obtaining unbiased estimates of population size.  Using radio-collared or captured cats and invasively collected genetic samples could be used as a means of identifying cats or producing the initial marking event but resampling must be done independently of knowledge about cat locations.  Potentially transects could be searched for cougar scats but this is likely to be inefficient and yield low sample sizes.  The use of scat-searching dogs may also be possible but efficiency may still be low, especially in large areas where access may be limited.  Another option would be to use hunter harvest as the resampling event.  Concerns with this would be sex and age bias in the harvest, but stratification may overcome these issues.  A final potential approach would be to mark prey and locate scats from known kill sites.  The only potential bias with this would be if marking prey affected how cats selected prey.  This approach would benefit from the short time span between scat deposition and collection.Other considerations when using scat are the quantity and quality of genetic material that can be obtained from the sample, which are factors of time since deposition and environmental conditions.  Extrinsic factors, such as season, diet, and sample age, can cause variation in genotyping error rates.  Potential weaknesses with noninvasive genetic sampling are low success rates, contamination concerns, and high genotyping error rates.  Even small genotyping errors (< 1%) cause reasonably large overestimation of population size.  Some of these errors include allelic dropout (alleles fail to amplify) and false alleles (spurious amplification of an allele that does not exist for a given individual). In a review of 21 population inventory studies, it has been stated that it is unclear what the frequencies of errors are for different types of errors in relation to the type and quality of the samples being collected and suggests that use of noninvasive sampling will be limited unless evidence is provided to support the reliability of the data.  It is also evident that siblings or closely related individuals provide the greatest challenge to genetically distinguishing individuals.  A marker system with the power to distinguish a small number of closely related individuals will also have sufficient power to distinguish among a large number of unrelated individuals.Noninvasive genetic sampling of cougar feces is one of the few methods available that may provide realistic estimates of cougar populations in Colorado, which is important since these populations are being exploited.  Before genetic sampling can be conducted, an assessment of potential genetic error rates must be made in order to appropriately design the sampling protocols and determine if such a method can provided reliable estimates.  Currently there are 3 sibling cougar in captivity at the CDOW Wildlife Health Lab, which can be used to produce known age feces.  These scat samples can be subjected to both controlled and uncontrolled environmental conditions in order to accurately assess the magnitude of error rates that may be expected if scats are used for noninvasive population estimation of cougar.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology In this investigation we will first test if the quantity of DNA sample is affected by whether the sample is taken along the surface of the scat or if it is taken as a cross-section of the scat.  Quantity of DNA in feces can be low and therefore, it will be beneficial to sample scats in order to maximize DNA quantity in the sample.  It may also be that genetic degradation due to some environmental factors is greater on the exposed surface of scats, which may indicate benefits of a cross-sectional sampling approach if genetic yield is sufficient.We will also test the variability in DNA quantity over successive depositions of feces.  It is likely that the amount of epithelial cells shed varies over time, which will affect the quantity of DNA in feces.  Understanding this variability will be important in sorting out other sources of variation in this study and will also help to determine if multiple scats should be collected from a single individual, if possible when sampling.  For example, if DNA quantities can be extremely low in some scats then this will be a potential reason for amplification failures.Our final hypothesis that we are testing is the rate of genetic degradation that occurs temporally, under various environmental conditions.  Some of these experiments will be done under controlled conditions, so that a relationship can be determined for the rate of degradation with respect to a specific factor.   Other analyses will involve scats that are subjected to more naturally occurring environmental conditions to help develop a better understanding of reasonable time frames following deposition that scats should be collected given particular environmental conditions. Individuals will be screened and genotyped using 15 nuclear microsatellite loci isolated from domestic cat. PCRs will be performed using a standard PCR protocols.PCR products will be diluted and run on the CEQ8000 XL DNA Analysis System (Beckman Coulter).

Due to proximity of banding sites to nesting areas in Rocky Mountain National Park, it cannot be accurately determined how long a family unit may remain together after beginning migration.

Reproduction was first documented in 2003 with subsequent successful reproduction in 2004-2006. However, no successful dens were documented in 2007 or 2008. The first successful reproduction by a female lynx born in Colorado from introduced parents occurred in 2006. Lynx are being recaptured yearly to maintain functioning radio-collars on a portion of the lynx population in order to monitor the ongoing establishment of lynx in Colorado.CDOW personnel have designed an occupancy modeling study to document the distribution and persistence of lynx in Colorado.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Tracking Clarks nutcracker movements and population structure using intrinsic markers: combining genetic and stable isotope signatures\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Studying animal migrations and seasonal movements has often involved the use of some sort of extrinsic marker, such as ear tags or collars for mammals or bands for birds. Typically, of the hundreds of individuals captured and marked, only a small percentage are caught or sighted again. For birds, tracking movements sometimes involved finding geographically distinct plumage variants (Hobson 1999, Hobson and Norris 2008).  With the populations of many migratory birds and other animals on the decline, tracking movements has become extremely important in recent years.  Understanding these movements is often critical for devising conservation strategies.  Today, new approaches being explored for tracking animals are based on intrinsic markers. Two groups of intrinsic markers that have promise include stable isotopes and genetic markers, particularly if used together (Hobson 1999, Kelly et al. 2008).  This pilot project will explore the use of both stable isotopes and two kinds of genetic markers, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellites to understand the movements of Clarks nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana), a bird whose population numbers and movements are sensitive to losses of high elevation forest in the western U. S. and Canada.  Relatively few studies to date have used genetic and isotopic techniques to understand patterns in population structure and movements of birds (see Kelly et al. 2005, Boulet et al 2006). This study potentially will provide information to help devise conservation strategies for nutcrackers, but also pioneers in its application of combined intrinsic marker techniques.  This goal of this study is to provide sufficient data to obtain federal funding for a multi-species, larger scale effort.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will catch approximately 5 Clarks nutcrackers in Rocky Mountain National Park with walk-in traps and collect a small amount of blood and five small contour feathers from each bird.  This will involve handling each bird only 5 to 10 min before release. The blood is required for the development of microsatellite DNA primers, which are currently not available for this species.  The feathers will provide us with a cursory stable isotope profile for bird feathers from Rocky Mountain National Park.We will isolated microsatellites from nutcracker blood samples and develop primers for them. Once primers are developed, the principal source of bird tissue samples for this study will be museum specimens of Clarks nutcracker, supplemented by frozen tissue available also from many museums. Working with the Department of zoology and Entomology, Denver Museum of Nature and Science, we will use online databases to identify museums with specimens from 5-7 distinct geographical regions.  We will request loans and sampling of these specimens for both genetic and stable isotope analysis.  The use of museum specimens enables us to sample a wide range of geographic locations without traveling long distances, obtaining permits, or spending days trying to catch birds. We will also examine the stable isotope signatures of several species of pine seeds currently in DFTs lab to determine isotopic profiles for these important food sources.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The objectives of this study are to examine molecular markers (mitochondrial and nuclear DNA) in individual birds to determine whether there is regional differentiation in nutcracker populations. Additionally, chemical markers (stable and radio isotope values) that are transferred to animals via food or water will be investigated as well.  The two marker types can be used in a stepwise manner as follows: first, we will use molecular markers to measure patterns of genetic differentiation among individuals from across various geographic locations. If we discover cases where specimens collected in geographically disparate locations are genetically similar, then isotope markers will be employed to determine whether we can link that individual to a geographic location where genetically similar individuals are more abundant (e.g. identify eruptive migrant influence).\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Analysis of population connectivity in Wyoming Greater Sage-grouse\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The distribution and abundance of Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have declined markedly throughout their entire range likely due to the loss, fragmentation, and degradation of sagebrush habitat.  Cumulative loss of habitat and declining population trends have led to several petitions to list the species as threatened or endangered.  Although Wyoming contains the largest populations of Greater Sage-grouse, substantial impacts from recent energy development also threaten these populations. Knowledge of the impact of current energy development projects as well as other anthropogenic disturbances on Greater Sage-grouse populations and connectivity among them is unknown. Previous genetic studies examined broad scale genetic patterns across the species range, yet a more comprehensive landscape approach using genetic data as well as habitat and anthropogenic spatial data is appropriate for this species.  The movement of individuals among subdivided populations is often essential for population persistence. However, movement among populations can be hindered by various landscape features. For several grouse species, patches of unsuitable/poor habitat above a particular size threshold can prevent successful movement of individuals between populations.  The resulting population isolation can have serious negative impacts on population persistence. Thus, identification of populations and connectivity levels among them can inform the prioritization of habitats for conservation and identify habitat and anthropogenic features that impair the connectivity among populations. We propose to initiate work in Wyoming as we have already begun collecting feather samples from leks. Additionally, we have comprehensive Greater Sage-grouse habitat and distribution maps developed in Wyoming to aid in this project. This landscape genetic analysis would identify demographically independent populations and could be used to delineate management units and manage the effects of human activities on the abundance of individuals within populations.  This study will facilitate a cohesive management strategy that takes genetic distinctiveness into account, and that can be based in part on a clear picture of the entire genetic landscape of a species.  Ultimately, this will both increase the efficiency with which management decisions can be made, and add to their scientific foundation.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We have developed dozens of microsatellite primers that work on a variety of grouse species and have pioneered techniques to extract genetic information from feather or blood samples that could provide the data for a comprehensive analysis of connectivity.  We will use well established methods for assessing population structure including standard population-based analyses (e.g. pairwise FST) and individual-based analyses using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches.  We will test for correlations between geographic and genetic distance and will assess levels of genetic diversity and inbreeding. Barriers to gene flow will be identified using Monmoniers algorithm and suggested barriers will be overlaid on sagebrush distributional maps for Wyoming and broad-scale habitat maps across the species range (i.e., Landfore).  We will quantify the relationship between habitat, anthropogenic disturbances, and genetic population fragmentation. We will also explore the applicability of several newly described analytical approaches in landscape genetics.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The objectives of this study are to use genetic data to delineate biologically meaningful Sage-grouse population boundaries in Wyoming, quantify individual movements among populations, locate and map potential barriers to individual movement among populations, assess overall levels of connectivity among Wyoming Sage-grouse populations, and evaluate how coarse-scale landscape and anthropogenic features (elevation, slope, roads, rivers) influence population connectivity.  Additionally, we aim to integrate genetic data with seasonal distributional models to produce a comprehensive prioritization of habitats in Wyoming based on genetic connectivity information and seasonal habitat models, compare genetic structure and connectivity of currently established core areas to assess connectivity and genetic variation among and within core areas, and use models of future landscape changes likely to result from climate change and anthropogenic habitat modification (e.g. oil and gas, and wind development) to predict future connectivity among populations across plausible future landscapes.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan In the early stages of this project, preliminary results will be presented at annual Greater Sage-grouse working group meetings as well as some national conferences (e. g., AOU, The Wildlife Society).  In later stages, results will be presented in manuscript form and submitted to peer review journals.   Primary users of the information generated by this research will be land management agencies, federal and state governments, universities, and non-governmental organizations. The current anticipated users of this information will include US Geological Survey, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Wyoming Game and Fish. Data and technology transfer will be accessible through presentations, publications in a peer-reviewed journal and accessing data generated from federally funded programs through the NBII.  Final reports, presentations, and journal publications to partners and collaborators will be made available to all interested researchers and resource managers for consideration of incorporating these results into their management programs. More importantly the products obtained from the molecular research will give the opportunity to integrate research techniques, increase collaboration, and provide new approaches for future research at the USGS.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings We found that low-quality nesting and winter seasonal habitats are strong predictors of reduced gene flow between greater sage-grouse breeding locations in Wyoming. Our study compared the genetic differences between greater sage-grouse breeding areas with seasonal habitat distributions or combinations of landscape factors  such as amount of sagebrush habitat, agriculture fields or roads  to understand how each factor or combination of factors influence effective dispersal of sage-grouse across the state. Understanding how habitat and landscape features impact the effective dispersal of a species is important for informing management and conservation decisions across large landscapes. Dispersal effectiveness can be measured by gene flow, the rate at which genetic material moves between populations. When populations become small and isolated, a reduction in gene flow can lead to reduced genetic diversity, making those populations potentially less resilient to environmental stressors. This research identified which seasonal habitats and individual landscape features facilitate and impede gene flow across the state of Wyoming  which is a stronghold for sage-grouse populations. Greater sage-grouse are dependent upon sagebrush, so two populations separated only by sagebrush habitat would be expected to have more individuals moving between them and be more genetically similar than two populations separated by a barrier to sage-grouse movement, such as a mountain range or forest. We found that the juxtaposition and quality of nesting and winter seasonal habitats were the greatest predictors of gene flow for greater sage-grouse in Wyoming. Furthermore, the combinations of high levels of forest cover and highly rugged (steep and uneven) terrain or low levels of sagebrush cover and highly rugged terrain were correlated with low levels of gene flow among sage-grouse populations. Maintaining natural levels of gene flow among populations helps ensure resilience for the species. Ultimately, land managers can use this information to identify habitats that are most important for maintaining effective dispersal between populations and to improve future sage-grouse conservation efforts.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Contribution of landscape characteristics to long-term viability of greater sage grouse\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Habitat and population fragmentation were among the primary factors contributing to the recent US Fish and Wildlife Service decision that listing greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus, hereafter sage-grouse) was warranted but currently precluded by higher priority actions. Increasingly, current management is focused on core or priority areas containing the highest densities of breeding birds with little regard to understanding connectivity within and among areas. The most fundamental objective of species conservation is to first identify and subsequently maintain a set of viable and connected populations. Therefore, if management emphasis on core areas is to be successful for long-term conservation, it is important to know (1) the spatial delineation of breeding populations across the range-wide distribution of sage-grouse, (2) how primary populations located in high quality habitat are interconnected across regions of lower population densities and less suitable habitat, and (3) the spatial scale and relative importance of landscape features that influence gene flow.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will develop the design to sample genetic materials (feathers) from leks across the western portion of the sage-grouse range.  The western range of sage-grouse contains approximately 3,000 known leks.  Therefore, sampling all leks and individuals is not feasible.  Instead, we will need to identify spatial and temporal genetic relatedness among a subset of leks within regions containing the range of landscape characteristics that influence dispersal. The design also will incorporate a hierarchical approach to draw local, regional, and range-wide conclusions.Pending funding, the second and third year would be used to sample leks and conduct the genetic analyses.  We have permission from state wildlife agencies to sample leks in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah.  Feathers also may be available from a current study in California. We will take measures to assure that our genetic data is comparable to other similar efforts in the eastern part of the range (Wyoming and Montana).  In the final year, we would apply the cost-surface models of sage-grouse movements to predict population viability relative to current and proposed land use actions, and to long-term shifts in vegetation predicted under climate change scenarios.  The results from this project will be important for interpreting our other ongoing project to identify and map the ecological minimums required by sage-grouse.  Combined, the two studies delineate current and future habitat distributions and the likelihood that sage-grouse can tract those shifts given potential barriers.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives We will combine genetic markers and landscape analyses to define the spatial structure of sage-grouse populations and environmental influences on dispersal.  Genetic information can be extracted from sage-grouse feathers lost from birds displaying on breeding grounds (leks).  By collecting feathers at multiple leks, we can delineate the genetic relatedness among breeding locations within the sage-grouse population.  Genetic relatedness coupled with landscape analyses then can be used to determine how features, such as geographic distance, topographic characteristics, or anthropogenic land uses can influence dispersal.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Linking Host-Associated Gut Microbial Communities and Immuno-Response in a Unique Avian Model\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Host-associated microbial communities play a major role in health and disease.  There are well known interactions between the innate and adaptive immune system and the millions of microbes inhabiting the vertebrate gastrointestinal tract (gut microbiota).  Each vertebrate species has a characteristic species-specific community of microbes that reflects its phylogeny, environment, and diet. Understanding the physiological and ecological principles that govern the formation and persistence of host-associated microbial communities is a cornerstone for understanding fundamental aspects of immune function and is expected to provide major insights for improving human health. We are using the brown-headed cowbird as a model organism for investigating the relationship between diversity and structure of gut microbiota and effectiveness of immune responses. The cowbird gut microbiota is of particular interest because the cowbird has an unusually effective immune system, and there is an intimate relationship between gut microbiota and immune function. The cowbird has (i) more effective resistance to West Nile virus; (ii) more effective innate immune responses, cellular-level mechanisms; and (iii) elevated immune factors in eggs, including both immunoglobulins and lysozymes. The cowbird has a unique life history that provides a potential mechanism that would explain why its gut microbiota might be responsible for its exceptional immuno-ressistance. The brown-headed cowbird is a generalist parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of >200 other avian species.  These species serve as foster parents and provide parental care. Since the gut tissue is sterile at hatching and is colonized by microbial species in the immediate environment, we predict that the cowbird gut colonization is unusually diverse due to exposure to its many foster parent species and nest environments.  The cowbird gut microbiota thus offers a unique ecological experiment in investigating gut colonization principles under disruptive and conflicting conditions, since the process normally entails exposure to individuals of a single species in a characteristic nesting habitat.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We have collected samples of cowbird (and red-winged blackbird as a reference species) gut tissue, as well as cloacal and pharyngeal swabs, that we propose to analyze using genomic, next-generation sequencing techniques. We will amplify and sequence the bacterial 16S ribosomal gene from DNA extracted from the gut, cloacal and pharyngeal samples and to analyze the composition of the associated microbial communities.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Our objectives are to compare the diversity and bacterial community composition of cowbird microbiomes with that of the red-winged blackbird, a closely-related, non-parasitic species, with consistently less effective immune responses.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan \n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings We hybpothesized that the cowbird microbiome is more diverse than the red-winged blackbird microbiome.  We found that our data are consistant with this hypothesis.  We were also interested in whether gut microbiome diversity was similar to cloacal diversity in the same individual.  While we found that the biome communities are different in the gut and cloaca of the same individual, we did find that the best predicotr of cloacal diversity was gut diversity.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle QRP  Genetic diversity and population connectivity of Prebles Meadow jumping mouse within the South Recovery Unit\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem To meet the delisting criteria for recovery of PMJM, USFWS must document and maintain wild, self-sustaining [PMJM] populations (PMJM Recovery Team 2010).  Information on population trends for PMJM has been lacking, but recently Schorr (2012) documented a declining trend over a 7-year period for the southernmost PMJM population (Fig. 1).  He found recruitment was substantially more important than survival at influencing PMJM population growth rate (Schorr 2012).  As recruitment is comprised of fecundity and immigration, it is important to understand how both of these components are influencing population growth.  It is believed that population decline in the southernmost PMJM population is impacted substantially by decreased habitat connectivity (Schorr 2012).  As PMJM are associated with riparian areas, movement is restricted to riparian corridors and adjacent uplands.  Thus, dispersal is constrained to populations in close proximity along contiguous habitat.  If PMJM population stability is a function of dispersal among populations, then, as populations become more isolated, their probability of recovery should decrease.  In addition to decreasing dispersal, isolation limits genetic exchange, which is vital for maintaining adaptive potential. With limited exchange of individuals and small population sizes there are risks of genetic drift and declining levels of genetic diversity. These issues are exacerbated when habitat continuity is interrupted. Vignieri (2005) investigated the genetic exchange among populations of a related jumping mouse (Pacific jumping mouse) and found that the exchange of individuals and genetic diversity was limited to exchange of individuals via riparian corridors. The two southernmost recovery populations for PMJM (West Plum/East Plum Creeks and Monument Creek) are separated by approximately 19 km (12 miles) and a low-elevation divide (Fig. 1). Despite the distance between the units and the presence of a possible isolation mechanism, these groups were recognized as being more similar to each other than to PMJM populations north of Denver, CO (King et al. 2006a).  It is unclear if there is sufficient connectivity between these two units to justify structuring conservation plans similarly or to develop unit-specific strategies that address population and genetic isolation concerns.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Microsatellite markers have been used previously to clarify jumping mouse conservation and dispersal questions (Vignieri 2005, King et al. 2006a).  King et al. (2006a) used 21 microsatellite genetic markers to diagnose PMJM as a separate subspecies of Z. hudsonius, and identified two separate population groups: South and North.  Vignieri (2005) used 8 microsatellite markers to determine genetic exchange pathways for Z. trinotatus among three adjacent river systems within the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. We propose to use the 21 microsatellite markers developed by King et al. (2006b) to investigate levels of genetic structure and diversity within the southern portion of the range of PMJM.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Landscape Genetic Vulnerability Assessment for Gunnison Sage-Grouse\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Gunnison Sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus) are an obligate sagebrush species that has experienced significant population declines, and has been designated as a Candidate Species for listing under the ESA.  The Fish and Wildlife Service is currently preparing a proposed rule and proposed critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act.  The entire species range consists of 1 moderately sized population in the Gunnison Basin (~ 500 strutting males) that is surrounded by 6 small, isolated, satellite populations, most of which have fewer than 50 strutting males (Colorado  Parks and Wildlife, unpublished lek data).  The Gunnison Basin, therefore, represents an extremely important component of the species range that requires careful management. The Curecanti National Recreation Area comprises a significant portion of the Gunnison Basin. Within the Gunnison Basin, significant interest is focused on identifying and spatially mapping critical habitat for all life stages of Gunnison Sage-grouse (see Aldridge et. al 2012), in addition to understanding how these habitats are connected throughout the Basin.  The identification of these areas and their juxtaposition across the landscape will allow for an informed evaluation of economic, social, and wildlife costs and benefits associated with different future development strategies.  The results of this research will greatly assist the Service and other Federal and State partners (NPS, BLM) to integrate a landscape perspective in the management of this highly imperiled species.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We propose to integrate seasonal habitat modeling with genetic data on connectivity to better understand Gunnison Sage-grouse habitat needs and patterns of gene flow across the Gunnison Basin. We will first assess functional habitat connectivity between mapped seasonal habitats across the Basin.  We will then employ molecular genetic techniques to examine patterns of gene flow across the Basin, looking for current and potential barriers to movement.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives We will employ fine scale molecular genetic techniques to examine connectivity among local groups of Gunnison Sage-grouse across the Basin.  This analysis will identify groups (demes) of Gunnison Sage-grouse that are demographically independent and analyze those delineations in relation to habitat and anthropogenic variables, providing managers with tools to better understand connectivity among areas.  This information will be integrated with seasonal habitat models for Gunnison Sage-grouse that will identify what habitat characteristics are essential for each life-stage of this species.  This integrated approach will allow managers to not only identify critical habitats, but also prioritize those habitats for protection and management using strategies that will also maximize levels of connectivity both within and across life stages.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan The primary physical products are habitat models, at least one peer-reviewed journal articles and papers presented at scientific meetings.  These document scientific findings and communicate them to a technical audience. Our products will also serve as tools for managers and scientists assessing the consequences of climate change for wildlife populations; therefore, direct communication of results and methods from researchers to managers is needed.  We will provide annual reports and presentations to the Curecanti NRA staff, directly sharing our research results with Park managers.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Mendenhall- Genomic approaches to quantify adaptive genetic diversity and conduct landscape genetic analyses to maximize evolutionary resilience in white-tailed ptarmigan.\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Climate change represents a major threat to biodiversity. Species restricted to alpine environments are assumed to be particularly susceptible because of the limited possibility of upward movement; however, extinction risk for alpine endemics may be lower if populations have the capacity to evolve in response to changing environmental conditions. Evolution was once thought to be a process that acted over long time-scales. However, there is now growing appreciation for the importance of rapid evolution acting on ecological time-scales and its relevance for long-term conservation planning. To guide planning efforts, Sgr et al. (2011) outlined a set of management options available for building evolutionary resilience  a term they coined to describe the ability of populations to undergo future evolutionary change. A key component of their recommendations revolved around maintaining genetic diversity within populations, which is critical for adaptive evolution because natural selection can only act when there is a sufficient amount of heritable variation in fitness-related traits. They also stressed the importance of identifying and conserving among-population variation in genetic structure, especially for species that occupy a variety of environmental conditions across their geographic range. Unfortunately, a major impediment to the design of management plans that explicitly recognize evolutionary processes is a lack of comprehensive genetic data. Recent advances in genomic technology provide a path forward because researchers now have an efficient and cost-effective method of quantifying neutral and adaptive genetic diversity at thousands of locations across the genome, data that can be used to integrate evolutionary processes into conservation and landscape management planning.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We obtained white-tailed ptarmigan samples from Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Montana, Washington, British Columbia, the Yukon, and Alaska. DNA was extracted from those samples. All individuals were genotyped at 15 microsatellite loci, and 95 of them were genotyped at 14,866 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci (using a reduced-representation genomics approach). Those two datasets have been analyzed using numerous methods to examine genetic variation across the species' range.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Our project seeks to use the white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura) as a test case to examine the utility of genomic data for developing management strategies aimed at maximizing evolutionary resilience in species at risk from climate change. The species is endemic to alpine and sub-alpine habitats in mountainous regions across western North America, from Alaska to New Mexico. It is assumed to be vulnerable to climate change because projected warming is expected to reduce the quality and quantity of suitable ptarmigan habitat, especially in southern portions of the species' range (e.g., in Colorado). There are five recognized subspecies of white-tailed ptarmigan, but those subspecific designations are based on morphological information and have yet to be verified with genetic data. This is an issue because the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is currently considering listing the two southernmost subspecies on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and they can only do so if there is evidence that the subspecies form \"distinct population segments.\" Given these conservation and management considerations, our project seeks to address the following questions: (1) Are current subspecies designations supported by genomic data? If not, how should populations be grouped into distinct population segments?, (2) Are southern populations adaptively divergent?, and (3) How do landscape and climate variables influence patterns of genetic variation?\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan The results of this study will be presented at scientific meetings, in peer-reviewed publications, and in stakeholder meetings. We envision multiple publications to arise from this work, including one delineating intraspecific units for conservation in the white-tailed ptarmigan and another testing for adaptive genetic variation across environmental gradients. We also plan to communicate with people in numerous management agencies to discuss how our work is relevant to their efforts at managing/studying/etc. white-tailed ptarmigan and other high elevation species. This includes  but is not limited to  the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the US National Park Service, and Parks Canada.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The delineation of intraspecific units that are evolutionarily and demographically distinct is an important step in the development of species-specific management plans. Neutral genetic variation has served as the primary data source for delineating units for conservation, but with recent advances in genomic technology, we now have an unprecedented ability to utilize information about neutral and adaptive variation across the entire genome. Here, we use traditional genetic markers (microsatellites) and a newer reduced-representation genomic approach (single nucleotide polymorphisms) to delineate distinct groups of white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura), an alpine-obligate species that is distributed in naturally fragmented habitats from Alaska to New Mexico. All analyses, regardless of dataset and method, demonstrated that the most geographically isolated subspecies (L. l. altipetens and L. l. saxatilis) formed distinct groups that were divergent from each other and from the other subspecies (L. l. rainierensis, L. l. leucura, and L. l. peninsularis). The extent of divergence was not as pronounced throughout the remainder of the species range (from Washington to Alaska), although some spatial genetic structure was apparent. Results based on genetic and genomic datasets generally agreed with one another, indicating that in many cases microsatellite loci may be sufficient for describing major patterns of genetic structure across species ranges. This work will inform future management and listing decisions for the white-tailed ptarmigan, a species that may be vulnerable to future changes in climate.\n",

Modern DNA sequencing technologies have now made whole-genome sequencing practical for species of conservation concern. We are working to generate the first whole-genome sequence for both Gunnison Sage-grouse and Greater Sage-grouse--two iconic species of the American West that are of considerable conservation and management concern. In addition to serving as a resource to support future genetic work in these species, these reference genomes are currently being used to (1) investigate divergence at the whole-genome level between sage-grouse species and among Greater Sage-grouse populations; (2) reconstruct historical demographic trends in both sage-grouse species using coalescent models; and (3) scan for genetic adaptations to environmental variation across the Greater Sage-grouse species range. Of particular interest are potential adaptations to consuming different sagebrush types, many of which exhibit distinct profiles of toxic secondary metabolites. Recent studies have highlighted metabolic pathways in sage-grouse that appear highly efficient at breaking down these toxic compounds, suggesting that some populations might be uniquely adapted to local sagebrush types.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Developing and testing eDNA assays for giant constrictor snakes in Florida\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The introduction of giant constrictor snakes in southern Florida is threatening successful ecological restoration of the Greater Everglades ecosystem (GEE). Native to Southeast Asia, Burmese pythons are established and reproducing in Florida. They also pose a significant threat to native prey species, including mammals, birds, and reptiles listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. A number of mammal species may have suffered precipitous declines in the GEE in areas already inhabited by the Burmese python. In addition to the Burmese python, the Northern African python (P. sebae; also known as the African rock python), and boa constrictor (Boa constrictor) are locally established along the western and southern fringes of Miami, respectively. The reticulated python (P. reticulatus) and the green (Eunectes murinus) and yellow (E. notaeus) anaconda are also found in the pet trade and are species of concern as potential invaders. Free-ranging individuals of all three species have been found in Florida, but are not known to have established populations. Pythons and boa constrictors use aquatic habitats facultatively, whereas anacondas are almost entirely aquatic.Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly being used for detection of rare and non-native species to inform management actions, especially when traditional field methods are inadequate. Environmental DNA originates from cellular material shed by organisms into water or soil, and can be used for species detection. The ability to detect invasive species at low densities or prior to establishment is critical for successful control and eradication, making eDNA an useful tool for management of invasive species. Environmental DNA has the potential to be a powerful tool for enhancing early detection of giant constrictor snakes and to direct rapid response efforts; the technique also provides a decision-support tool for long-term management strategies. Non-invasive monitoring of aquatic habitats can assist in identifying newly-colonized areas, as well as movement corridors and potential pathways of dispersal. More precise information on the presence of harmful constrictors in critical habitats can inform spatiotemporal assessment of risk to imperiled native species (i.e., ground-dwelling birds, Key Largo woodrat, Florida panther), and potentially allow for targeted removal efforts prior to realization of major ecological and economic impacts. Environmental DNA tools can also assist with short or long term monitoring to determining whether control or eradication efforts are successful.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology In this study we will develop species-specific quantitative pcr assays for each of the 5 constrictor snakes.  We will validate these assays through both field and lab trials.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives In this study we had three objectives: (1) to develop and evaluate species-specific TaqMan qPCR primers and probes for five species of difficult to detect invasive giant constrictors (Burmese python, Northern African python, boa constrictor, and the green and yellow anaconda), (2) to use eDNA field-detections to geographically delineate presence of these constrictors, and (3) to calculate the first estimates of Burmese python occurrence using eDNA detected in water samples from various regions of southern Florida, while accounting for errors in detection using qPCR replicates.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan \n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Low detection of invasive giant constrictors using visual surveys and traps has hampered the estimation of occupancy and detection estimates needed for population management in southern Florida, USA. Giant constrictor snakes pose athreat to native species and the ecological restoration of the Florida Everglades. To assist with detection, we developed species-specific eDNA assays using quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the Burmese python (Python molurus biivittatus), Northern African python (P. sebae), boa constrictor (Boa constrictor), and the green (Eunectes murinus) and yellow anaconda (E. notaeus). Burmese pythons, Northern African pythons, and boa constrictors areestablished and reproducing, while the green and yellow anaconda have the potential to become established. We validated the python and boa constrictor assays using laboratory trials and tested all species in 21 field locations distributed in eight southern Florida regions.Burmese python eDNA was detected in 37 of 63 field sampling events; however, the other species were not detected. Although eDNA was heterogeneously distributed in the environment, occupancy models were able to provide the first estimates of detection probabilities, which were greater than 91%. Burmese python eDNA was detected along the leading northern edge of the known population boundary. The development of informative detection toolsand eDNA occupancy models can improve conservation efforts in southern Florida and support more extensive studies of invasive constrictors. Generic sampling design and terminology are proposed to standardize and clarify interpretations of eDNA-based occupancy models.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments The sensitive and specific eDNA tools presented here can be used to develop improved detection probabilities and assist with early detection of non-established species and range delimitation for established species, especially as they move north [35,36]. Further, soil samples from game trails, roadway shoulders, and canal roads could be tested for their utility in detecting constrictors on land.  Although eDNA can persist in soil for long periods of time, detections could help to delineate species range-limits. These tools, like others such as traps or intense surveys, can be used to improve detection of pythons in occupied areas. However, even with sampling strategies, the tool may not be highly informative if target species occur at very low densities or are patchily distributed.  Furthermore, while eDNA is a very promising method for determining occupancy of invasive giant constrictors in an area, translating eDNA detections into snake captures may be difficult. Once an area is targeted for snake removal, individual snake detection strategies, such as detector dogs, may improve population control efforts. Information on density effects, minimum volume, and number of PCRs will be further addressed using site occupancy models. Detection of species at high densities or prior to colonization of important habitats (e.g., wildlife refuges, bird nesting colonies etc.) could be used to target removal efforts or increase the possibility of local eradication. Further, eDNA can assist with assessing the success of large snake control or removal efforts within strategic areas. These tools may also prove useful in detecting critical habitats for conservation in Southern and Southeast Asia, where Burmese pythons are considered vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [37].\n"

      "\t\tTaskTitle Sandhill crane\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The Migratory Bird Program of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service is interested in exploring new ways to assess the abundance and distribution of Sandhill Cranes (Grus canadensis) in the Central Flyway. There are principally two sub-species and six migratory populations of Sandhill Cranes in North America.  The breeding grounds of Rocky Mountain Population Greater Sandhill Cranes (G. c. tabida) consist of areas in the intermountain west from Utah and Colorado north to Montana, but not into Canada. The Midcontinent Population of Sandhill Cranes, comprised of both Greater (G. c. tabida) and Lesser (G. c. canadensis) Sandhill Cranes breeds primarily from Canada northwest to Alaska and Siberia. Enroute to the wintering grounds, these two populations mix at important stopover sites in the San Luis Valley of Colorado. The ratios of these sub-species in the San Luis Valley migrating population are unknown and this information represents a critical need for the management of these populations.  Previous genetic research has shown that the two sub-species can be differentiated using mitochondrial sequence data (Rhymer et al. 2001, Glenn et al. 2002, and Peterson et al. 2003).  Additionally, stable isotope techniques have been used successfully to delineate the breeding origins of G. canadensis (Hobson et al.  2006).  We will explore here if DNA extracted from shed feathers and stable isotope methods can be used to distinguish Sandhill Crane sub-species from this particular staging area.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will characterize the distribution of these two sub-populations at stopover sites in the San Luis Valley Complex of the National Wildlife Refuge System.  We will collect shed feathers from several sites frequented by Sandhill Cranes.  Samples will be collected randomly at the sites, in an attempt to ensure that samples from both subspecies are collected. We will employ molecular genetic techniques to examine whether sub-species can be distinguished using feathers gathered daily from roost sites.  Additionally, we will analyze the &#948;D, &#948;13C, and &#948;15N isotopic composition of those same feather samples in an effort to constrain individuals at the sub-species level by identification of breeding grounds and differences in resource use on those grounds.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Migratory Birds is interested in testing data collection techniques used for migratory bird population assessments in a non-invasive, more cost-effective manner. In response, we propose to couple two non-invasive techniques (through the use of DNA sequencing and stable isotope analysis of shed feathers) to explore whether such methods can be used to distinguish Sandhill Crane sub-species from this particular staging area. This project combines two emerging technologies that may result in an improved, non-invasive, and potentially cost-effective tool for monitoring Sandhill Cranes and perhaps other species with similar behaviors.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The mtDNA analysis showed that all samples fell into one of two deeply diverged clades that have previously been used to describe the different subspecies.  The microsatellite data, however, show that there is much mixed between the two subspecies and is likely a reflect of current (rather than historical gene flow).  Thus, these particular genetic markers are not useful for determining the current distribution of different subspecies at stop over sites.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle SSP - Identifying patterns of divergence and units for conservation in the boreal toad species group using genetic and genomic approaches\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas) is listed as Endangered by the states of Colorado and New Mexico (where it is extirpated).  The Southern Rocky Mountain (SRM) population (which includes all of the range in CO, NM and southeastern WY) was considered to be a candidate species for listing as threatened or endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) from 1995 to 2005. In 2005, it was removed from the list due to a lack of conclusive genetic data.  Conservation organizations petitioned to reconsider the status of this species in May 2011. This resulted in the USFWS issuing a 90-day Finding in April 2012 concluding that there is substantial information to indicate that listing of the Eastern Population as a distinct population segment (DPS) may be warranted. The Eastern Population includes the SRM and toad populations in Utah, southwest Wyoming, southeast Idaho, northeast Nevada and possibly much of Nevada (Goebel, recent unpublished data). Analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA microsatellites indicate that the Eastern Population is distinct from boreal toads to the north and west, from other subspecies of the western toad, and from other closely related species in the boreal toad complex. However, there is further need to evaluate the degree to which the Eastern Population diverges from other toads in the complex and whether the SRM population should be recognized as a distinct unit separate from the rest of range of the Eastern Population.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology A. Methods: Specimen identification and laboratory work. Available tissue samples previously include those collected from across the full range of the group as well as from the eastern portion of the distribution (N=288, Goebel et al. 2009, Fig. 1; N=110; Goebel 2000).  Preliminary data collected in 2015 will refine geographic regions where additional samples will need to be collected. Additional samples will be requested from focal states and collected by State and/or Federal field personnel (e. g., Wyoming Game and Fish has already sent additional samples).We will identify the number of samples that need to be examined from each geographic region to identify the phylogenetic distribution of divergent lineages. To do this, we will use an iterative process to identify the nuclear genes that provide the greatest number of variable sites within the geographic region of interest.  This process allows for the most efficient collection of data. Initially, sequence data will be obtained from nuclear and mitochondrial genes from 30 samples representing three groups that show varying levels of divergence. These 30 samples will also be genotyped using the genomic RAD method. We will then obtain sequence data and RAD data from throughout the eastern region, focusing on the localities where nuclear and mitochondrial clades show some phylogeographic overlap. Ultimately, a third round of sequencing (and potentially RAD analysis) will be conducted to refine the geographic distribution of clades especially in the zones of overlap.  Laboratory work (DNA extraction from tissue samples, DNA amplification and template preparation) will be conducted by Anna Goebel at FGCU. All genomic work, and sequencing of nuclear and mitochondrial genes will be conducted by Sara Oyler-McCance at the FORT Molecular Ecology Lab in Fort Collins, CO. Data analyses will be conducted collaborative by both Anna and Sara.B. Methods: Data analyses. Multiple analyses will be conducted on the new sequence data. The evolutionary history and phylogeography of each gene will be obtained with Bayesian, parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses as in Goebel et al. (2009). Geographic structure of genetic variation will be examined with analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA; Excoffier et al. 1992) and the program STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al. 2000) including samples from across the species complex. More fine scale population structure of the eastern region (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, northeastern Nevada, and southeastern Idaho) will be further examined by calculating FST statistics to measure divergence (Arlequin 3.1, Excoffier & Schneiser 2005). Information from these analyses will be used in combination to identify the units for conservation.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The proposed research would determine the genetic units or evolutionary status of lineages within the Eastern group and provide the USFWS with information necessary to evaluate future decisions regarding listing under the Endangered Species Act. Because it is unclear how many samples will be required without preliminary data nor do we know how many additional samples will be available (due to the declining populations), we propose a tiered approach to data collection.  We propose to: 1.Obtain sequence data from three nuclear genes and SNP genotype data (tens of thousands of SNP loci using genomic RAD sequencing) from 30 samples representing three populations. Ten samples from Colorado will be used as the baseline for the SRM population within the Eastern group.  Ten samples from west central Wyoming will be used to examine a group that is in the zone of overlap between the eastern mtDNA clade and the NW clade.  And ten samples from Montana will be examined which may represent the NW group.  From these populations multiple levels of divergence will estimated; variation within the SRM population, and variation between the SRM population as a representative of the Eastern group and the NW clade in Montana.  This will allow us to assess the utility of genetic data for identifying taxonomic groups.  In addition, the variation among the three populations, Eastern group (SRM population) the northwest group (Montana) and the Wyoming group (a suspected mix of Eastern and Northwest groups) will allow us to estimate the utility of sequence data and genomic data for identifying genetic divergence within zones of overlap.2.Obtain sequence data from at least three nuclear genes of more than 100 samples representing the Eastern population and toads immediately surrounding the Eastern population in Wyoming, Idaho, Utah and Nevada. These will include a mix of newly collected samples (collected summer 2015) and previously collected samples for which mtDNA  data exists. Depending on the results from the first 30 samples, an additional group of samples will be run using the RAD technique focusing on the Eastern population and its boundaries.  3.Sequencing data will be used to determine phylogenetic relationships using Bayesian, parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods. SNP data will be used to estimate genetic differentiation within the SRM population, within the Eastern group, and the ability to identify zones of overlap between the Eastern group and other groups using standard methods.4.As data from this study are combined with data from multiple studies the phylogeographic structure and geographic pattern of genotypes can be identified.  In combination these will be used to delineate geographic boundaries of management units.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Restoration of Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (CSTG) to northern Nevada through the translocation of grouse from source populations in southeastern Idaho is needed to restore a self-sustaining population of CSTG to northern Nevada. Ideally, such a population would grow to the point of uniting, as a large metapopulation, with CTSG in southern Idaho, an outcome that would act to protect and enhance CTSG in both Idaho and Nevada.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology FORT MEL is charged with identifying the parents of the chicks that are the result of translocation.  This will allow us to determine whether the father is in fact the donor from AI or from a copulation that occurred after release.

      "\t\tObjectives This project will entail translocating approximately 250 CSTG from Idaho to Nevada, across 5 years. After the fifth year, we will re-evaluate the need for additional years of augmentation. In addition to basic translocation, we initiated an experimental artificial insemination (AI) study to a subset of female CSTG prior to translocaton in an attempt to increase nest initiation rates. Artificial insemination has two strong potential benefits: (1) circumstantial evidence points to a lack of insemination as an important cause of failure to nest successfully by newly translocated female CSTG (Coates and Delehanty 2006), and (2) AI provides a potential mechanism to introduce genetic diversity into small, nascent CSTG populations that are only tentatively established in the early years of restoration.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Forecasting the effects of agricultural practices on prairie wetlands: implications for the conservation of migratory shorebirds\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Agriculturally driven environmental change and global warming can modify conditions for breeding and en route shorebirds of prairie and prairie wetland landscapes. Fecundity and juvenile survival of shortgrass prairie birds can be compromised by severe drought, and if drought conditions become more frequent and severe in North American prairie regions as predicted by some climate models, elevated concern for grassland bird populations is warranted.Conservation planning for prairie wetland landscapes is highly challenging because the wetlands are highly vulnerable to a myriad of factors, including land conversion, agricultural policies and practices, hydrology alteration, and water pollution from the application of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers. A conceptual model that addresses the influences of agricultural practices on prairie wetland landscapes can serve the conservation planning process by clarifing the roles and relative importance of a myriad of complex factors, serving as a catalyst for further discussion and brainstorming, and providing a tool in educating managers, landowners, and scientists. Further, a mathematical and spatially explicit model can help forecast the conditions on prairie wetland landscapes into the future, assist managers in deciding which conservation tools to emphasize (acquisition, easements, restoration, education) and be used to evaluate the effectiveness of current and proposed conservation approaches.The U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan (USSCP) is a partnership effort being undertaken throughout the United States to ensure that stable and self-sustaining populations of all shorebird species are restored and protected. The partners are actively working to improve and implement the plans many facets, including the establishement and refinement of research and monitoring plans for shorebirds in the western hemisphere.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Component 1 of the study. Forecasting the effects of agricultural practices on prairie wetlands: implications for bird conservation. (1) To build the conceptual model, we will seek information from several sources, including experts on agricultural practices, contaminants, sedimentation, wetland function and morphometry, mitigating effects of buffers, global warming, shorebirds, invertebrates, and human dimensions. This task will entail several interviews, conference calls, and brain-storming sessions. We will review and synthesize pertinent information from the scientific and unpublished literature and from recent and on-going projects. We will portray all information from the interviews and literature in diagrammatic form and provide summary information on each model component. (2) From the conceptual model, we will determine which variables can be reasonably estimated given the current state of knowledge and which variables warrant additional study. We will build and refine shorebirdlandscape and habitat relationships using new (Playa Lakes) and existing (Prairie Pothole) shorebird and wetland survey data, using protocol developed for estimating populations of en route shorebirds in extensive and dynamic wetland systems. We will conduct focused field work to more accurately parameterize select features of the model (for example, to determine whether grass buffers around wetlands reduce sedimentation rates and influence bird-use of wetlands). During the first year of the study, we will continue to build partnerships with the goals of enhancing the model as well as our ability to conduct additional focused field work in 2008. (3) Using contemporary approaches for parameter estimation, model selection, and multi-model inference, we will develop the mathematical and spatially explicit model, formulate equations, identify assumptions required by the equations, and implement the equations in computer code. We will apply the shorebird-landscape and habitat models to forecast results to evaluate the implications for shorebird conservation.Component 2 of the study. Prairie bird demography. We will prepare a manuscript that relates shortgrass prairie bird reproductive success with landscape and habitat features, bird densities, and environmental factors in fragmented and intact landscapes. This information can then be used to evaluate the efficacy of using Breeding Bird Survey information (1966 to present) and historic climate data to assess and forecast impacts of drought and climate change on population demography of birds. We will also prepare plans and research proposals for targeted field efforts to address effects of agriculture and climate change on the breeding ecology of prairie birds.Component 3.

The first component of this study will forecast the effects of current agricultural practices on prairie wetland landscapes and to determine the impact of various scenarios on habitat and food availability for migratory shorebirds. (1) The first objective is to develop a conceptual model that clearly identifies aspects of agricultural practices influencing wetlands in the prairie pothole and playa lake landscapes. This conceptual model will be based on scientific knowledge and expert opinion on the current state and future track of agriculture in our study regions. (2) A second objective is to develop a mathematical formulation for the model and to estimate the parameters where possible. (3) A third objective is to run the spatially-explicit model under various scenarios of sedimentation rates, global warming, agricultural and conservation practices to create future scenarios of expected wetland landscapes in 50, 100, and 200 years, and to interpret the results relative to shorebird populations and conservation planning. The second component of this project will further explore the interplay of agricultural practices, global warming, and drought on the population dynamics and ecology of shortgrass prairie birds.The third component of this project will be to serve on the Executive Board of the the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan (USSC), as Chair of the USSCP Monitoring Working Group and as co-chair of the trinational Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM).\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Component 1 of the study. We have completed the extensive literature review and synthesis, which encompasses more than 250 published sources and an additional 300 potential sources. The conceptual model has been drafted and refined; this model incorporates features of human dimensions (farm policy, agriculture intensification impacts), ecological processes (sedimentation, climate factors, and others), wetland and landscape condition and quality, and suitability for migratory shorebirds. Component 2 of the study. A manuscript entitled \"Nest survival patterns indicate favorable ecological conditions and optimal densities for prairie birds,\" based on an extensive dataset of 827 nests and 97 bird surveys, examines nest survival of Lark Buntings and other grassland birds relative to bird densities, habitat and landscape structure, and environmental variables at two scales, within a variegated landscape and across intact, variegated, and highly fragmented landscapes in the shortgrass prairie region of North America. Several factors accounted for variability in nest survival of Lark Buntings and other grassland birds. Nest age exerted a strong influence and was generally described by a cubic polynomial curve with survival increasing throughout egg laying and early incubation, declining until the mid-nestling period, and then increasing until fledging. The shape of this curve varied with precipitation, revealing a more precipitous drop in late-incubation and early nestling periods during drought. Nest survival decreased with greater landscape fragmentation at the large scale across the three landscapes, but not at the smaller scale within the variegated landscape. Survival of grassland bird nests also increased with increasing vegetation structure of study plots. Lark Bunting nest survival varied with bunting density as described by a quadratic polynomial, increasing with density below 1.5 birds/ha and decreasing with density between 1.5 and 3 birds/ha, suggesting that an optimal range of densities favors reproductive success in Lark Buntings, a semi-colonial nesting species. The existence of an optimal range of densities in this semi-colonial species can be elucidated by the commodity selection hypothesis at low densities and density dependence at high densities.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Climate change as a challenge to bird conservation in North America\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The rapid rate of climate change poses an unprecedented challenge to the long-term viability of populations, species, communities, and ecosystems. Anticipated common responses to rapid global warming are changes in geographic distributions of plant and animals (northward and upward range shifts), changes in the timing of ecological events (advanced dates of flowering and breeding), altered community structure and interactions (predator-prey and competitive interactions), and changes in ecological function (Root et al. 2003, Parmesan and Galbraith 2004). Impacts of global warming are evident in animal and plant populations (Root et al. 2003, Parmesan and Galbraith 2004, Mller et al. 2006), and in conjunction with other stressors such as habitat destruction and invasive species, global warming will likely lead to species extirpations and extinctions (Root et al. 2003).  Science-based information and decision-making tools to assist wildlife managers in proactively mitigating the effects of global change are urgently needed.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will study birds of two focal ecosystems that are highly vulnerable to climate change: shorebirds of the prairie wetlands of the Great Plains and land birds of the riparian ecosystems in the desert southwest region of North America.  Migratory shorebirds and prairie wetlands. We will build on known linkages between shorebird-habitat and landscape relationships, physiology, migration behavior, and reproduction to develop generalizations about the effects of climate change on shorebirds. We will (1) evaluate current and new global climate model (GCM) predictions of temperature, precipitation, and storm intensity, and identify the existing stressors to prairie wetlands, including agriculture and sedimentation, and (2) determine the long-term demographic consequences of climate change scenarios for migratory shorebirds. We will conduct a risk assessment of population dynamics of sandpipers to (a) determine the degree of change in precipitation patterns that would be necessary to cause a long-term decrease in population size, and (b) assess the likelihood that the climate will actually change by that determined amount.  We will develop a demographic model that links precipitation, female body condition, and migration phenology with expected reproduction, and run this model under historic and predicted future climate to identify the probability that populations will decline in the future under most likely climate scenarios.   Migrating riparian-dependent land birds. Riparian forests of southwestern North America are critical to the spring journeys of millions of songbirds travelling north to breeding areas across the U.S. and Canada. We will (1) determine the sensitivities of migrating songbirds to loss of riparian forests due to global change and water use patterns. By determining habitat-dependency patterns, specifically which species depend on riparian habitats as stopover sites during spring and fall migration and which species are more flexible in habitat use, we will identify species that are especially sensitive to climate change. We will identify species-specific seasonal patterns of habitat use and develop models to define habitat and landscape relationships of songbird migrants based on physical and biological covariates of sites.  The relative sensitivity to climate change of guilds of wetland birds. We will use previously developed dynamic programming models to evaluate the relative sensitivity of wetland bird guilds, defined by taxonomy, body mass, diel patterns, migratory distance, landscape-habitat dynamics, and foraging patterns, to future climate-change and land-use scenarios. This research will have direct applicability to conservation and management of more than 100 species of migratory wetland/riparian species.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The overall science question addressed by this work is \"How will climate changes predicted for arid and semi-arid regions of North America influence the survival and reproduction of migratory birds?\" We will specifically address several questions, including (1) How will climate change alter the spacing and quality of critical wetland stopover habitats? (2) What are the long-term demographic consequences of climate change on sandpipers? (3) What are the sensitivities of migrating songbirds to loss of riparian forests due to global change and water use patterns? and (4) What is the relative sensitivity to climate change of guilds of wetland birds? To answer these questions, we will evaluate current and new global climate model (GCM) predictions of temperature, precipitation, and storm intensity, analyze existing data sets, and draw heavily from the published scientific literature, and climate, hydrology, and population models.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Playas in the Great Plains Landscape Conservation Cooperative (GPLCC) are at risk for both increased sedimentation and reduced inundation due to predicted increased summer temperatures, decreased annual precipitation, and agricultural intensification (Smith 2003, Skagen et al. 2008). Playa wetlands provide many important wetland functions, including aquifer recharge, flood mitigation, and the enhancement of local, regional, and hemispheric biodiversity. Playas provide essential habitat for many wetland-dependent vertebrate species (Haukos and Smith 1994, Cariveau and Pavlacky 2009) and are especially important as critical refueling stops during spring and fall waterfowl and shorebird migrations (Skagen et al. 1999). Wetland breeding birds are identified as highly vulnerable to climate changes because of the impacts on water level and distribution (North American Bird Conservation Initiative, U.S. Committee 2010). Three independent projects are currently examining the relationship of specific rainfall events and surrounding land use on playa wetness (in northeastern Colorado/southwestern Nebraska and in north-central Oklahoma) and the potential for increased sedimentation across the GPLCC with projected precipitation changes. The work proposed here will extend the inundation studies across the GPLCC using existing field data on wetland condition to provide a perspective at multiple scales and will integrate the emerging findings of the playa inundation and sedimentation research.In the past four decades, the rates of population decline of obligate grassland and arid land bird species have exceeded the rates of decline in forest and wetland bird populations Concern of these declines has highlighted the urgency of grassland bird protection and management, and climate change will likely exacerbate these declines (North American Bird Conservation Initiative, U.S. Committee 2010). The population status and future of grassland birds are influenced by the interplay of natural and anthropogenic factors, including natural climatic variability and global warming, land use changes and fragmentation, agricultural practices, grazing, invasive species, and energy development. Informed and innovative approaches to wildlife-compatible land management are urgently needed to reverse these population declines.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Invasive herps can seriously impact the ecosystems they invade.  The brown treesnakes colonization of Guam has resulted in the loss of at least 17 vertebrates from the island over the last 4 decades, and its unprecedented high populations on Guam contribute to further dispersal to other islands where similar ecological perturbations are likely.  Effective management of invasive herp species, such as the brown treesnake, requires knowledge of the biology and ecology of the species within its introduced and potential ranges.  The ecological effects attributable to introduced populations of brown treesnakes are complex, spill down to many aspects of the terrestrial island ecosystem, and justify expanded efforts to reduce the problems.  Studies of the vertebrate fauna of Guam in the context of an introduced predator and comparable faunas and habitats on other islands which have not yet been altered by the snake are important to guiding management actions by several federal and local agencies.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology 1.A mark-recapture trapping program will be conducted within a snake-barrier enclosed 5h BTS population. Captured snakes will be individually marked and data collected on their sex, size, body condition and capture location.  Different control, capture, and detection methods (e.g. modified BTS traps, bait tubes) will be applied/tested within the marked population. These activities provide the data for objectives 1, 2, and 3.2.Canine detection methods will be tested at a site on Guam that has low BTS densities.  Snakes outfitted with radio transmitters will be planted at the site and radio telemetry will be used to verify presence and location of a snake relative to where dog teams indicate a snake occurs. 3.The effect of different lamp types on the effectiveness of visual searching will be tested at a TBD forested site on Guam.  Trained observers, assigned different lamp types, will perform one-sided visual search transects along which stuffed BTS of different sizes have been draped in natural poses. Snake sighting data from different lamp trials will be analyzed relative to the known locations of the planted snakes.  4.Previously initiated data collection on BTS thermal limits will be completed and data analyzed using standard statistical techniques.  5.Laboratory tests will be performed to determine if factors such as trap type, presence/absence of trap flap, presence/absence of glue boards, and presence/absence of scent or bait influence whether small BTS (those not captured by standard snake traps) enter and remain in traps.  Experimental technique to be used will be determined in FY07 or FY08. Analysis of data will be conducted to determine effect of snake SVL on trap entry and retention rate. 6.Ontenogenic food preferences in small BTS will be investigated via laboratory preference tests on snakes ranging from hatchling size to 650mm SVL.  Data on acceptance/rejection will be collected and analyzed.  7.The BTS Rapid Response Team will be maintained by conducting annual RR training courses for stakeholders and cooperators. Outreach and assistance with response plans will be conducted via the USGS BTS webpage, BTS list server, on-site presentations by RR Team members, presentations at BTS meetings and conferences, and networking with relevant individuals in both the public and private sectors. 8.New barrier designs will be tested in the laboratory, using methods developed for testing previously developed barriers.   9.Methods used for collecting and compiling data pertaining to management of other invasive herp species will depend on emerging issues, and the nature of any requests received from other agencies for assistance.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Over the past several years giant constrictors of several species have surfaced in the vicinity of Everglades National Park (EVER).  The best documented is the Burmese Python (Python molurus bivittatus), for which hundreds of specimens have been collected from EVER (S. Snow, pers. comm.).  An established population of Boa Constrictor (Boa constrictor) is found about 20 km east of the park, in the vicinity of Cutler Bay (Meshaka et al. 2004).  This population may or may not be related to a small number of individual boas that have been taken near the parks eastern boundary, or to the one individual collected in 2006 from the parks entrance road.  Feral Reticulated Pythons (Python reticulatus) have been collected at intervals in the metropolitan area adjoining the park to the east and northeast; in addition, Meshaka et al. (2004) cite several sightings in mangrove forest of the saline glades just north of Flamingo, EVER.  Following earlier reports, a specimen of the Green Anaconda (Eunectes murinus) was collected in 2005 at Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve, which adjoins the park on the northwest corner.  In 2006 additional reports of this species in that area were noted, but as yet there is only a single confirmed specimen.  Each of these four snake species has the potential to appreciably alter the natural community of life in EVER and throughout the southeastern United States (Reed 2005).\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle SSP 07-R6-04: Vaccination and flea control to assess invasion of plague into Conata Basin\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In 2005, plague expanded its range eastward into prairie dog colonies on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota, just 30 miles from the Conata Basin prairie dog colonies, crucial habitat for the self-sustaining black-footed ferret population that is the foundation of the ferret recovery program. About $250 K was expended in an attempt to protect the ferret habitat under the assumption that further invasion of the disease could be catastrophic for both prairie dogs and ferrets but with minimal understanding of the degree of threat posed by the disease. It is imperative that we gain a better understanding of the invasion potential for plague in prairie ecosystems east of the current range of plague. This proposed study will help discriminate between several working hypotheses, namely (1) that plague will fail to invade Conata Basin, (2) that 2005 was an anomaly in South Dakota, temporarily presenting conditions that will allow only transitory occupancy of the new range by plague, (3) that plague advanced during an optimal year but will fail to retract once it becomes established, remaining in Conata Basin as an enzootic resident.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Design within study sites 1There will be 3 dusted and 3 control plots. 2Experimental plots selected will be 25-50 ha each, encompassing entire prairie dog colonies (preferably) or portions thereof. 3The primary treatments will be repeated in pairs (dusted and non-dusted plots) with as little physiographic and biotic variation as possible between members of each pair (e.g., slope, aspect, burrow density, quantity and type of vegetative cover, prairie dog density). 4Half of the prairie dogs captured on each plot will be vaccinated with an experimental plague vaccine. 5All prairie dogs captured will be individually marked with a numbered ear tag in each ear. 6During each trapping session, the number of marked prairie dogs recaptured will be used to generate a capture history matrix from which survival will be estimated for the various treatment groups. 7Repeat the procedures described above for a minimum of 3 field seasons (allowing two annual survival estimates). B. Dusting for flea control 1A synthetic pyrethroid (e.g., DeltaDust) will be applied to prairie dog burrows with pressurized dust applicators at a rate of about 4 g per burrow. 2DeltaDust is labeled for use in rodent burrows for flea control. The application and safety prescription of the product label will be followed. 3Burrows will have been dusted in fall of the first year of the study (2005). Re- applications of dust will be accomplished during each field season of the study except the final field season. To accomplish this experiment, it will be necessary to continue to dust at least the =: 300 ha of the 6 experimental plots, but not necessarily the 2000 ha dusted in 2005. C. Vaccination 1On each plot (dusted and non-dusted), approximately 20 prairie dogs will be immunized against plague with F1-V antigen as previously described for black-footed ferrets (Rocke et al. 2004 and 2006), and an equivalent number of animals will be injected with a placebo. 2Prairie dogs will be recaptured within 3-4 weeks and boosted. D. Monitoring prairie dog survival and flea populations 1Prairie dogs will be trapped during June and July of each year. 2Recaptured vaccinates will be bled via toenail clip for antibody determinations. 3Prairie dogs from which fleas are to be collected (10-30 per experimental area) format.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings About one year after the dusting of 2012 in Conata Basin, flea prevalence was significantly higher than it had been at that point in 2007-2009 on the North Exclosure Prairie Dog Colony, and was also higher than June-July flea prevalence on prairie dogs of three additional non-dusted plots in Conata Basin during those earlier years. Although the 2013 dusting significantly reduced fleas, proportions of prairie dogs with fleas after dusting remained much higher than they were at about 2 months after dust application in a 2000 study in Colorado (8 % on dusted colonies and 75% on non-dusted colonies).  Fleas may have evolved resistance to deltamethrin in that 8-year period of repeated dust application.Two recent studies suggest that plague is having large impacts on prairie dogs of several species (including the threatened Utah prairie dog) and black-footed ferrets even when it does not erupt into epizootic form.  Plague management (via reducing its flea vectors) improved prairie dog annual survival by 31-45 % (Biggins et al. 2010), and flea control or an experimental plague vaccine improved ferret annual survival >200 % in Montana (Matchett et al. 2010). Use of the vaccine as a treatment in the ferret experiment precludes explanations other than plague, and the 5-year experiment with prairie dogs on sites in Montana and Utah demonstrates how widespread the phenomenon might be.  Plague was rarely detected using common diagnostic tests on hundreds of potential rodent hosts and thousands of their fleas at those study sites, illustrating that low detection rates or even lack of detection do not imply low risk to wildlife populations.  Ferret populations at the Montana study site have not been self-sustaining without plague management intervention.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Intercontinental movements of invasive species continue to modify the World's ecosystems. The plague bacterium (Yersinia pestis) has colonized and altered animal communities worldwide but has received much more attention as a human pathogen. Prairie dogs (Cynomys) epitomize taxa with high risk to plague because they have low resistance to plague and are highly social. Plague has become established within the ranges of the threatened C. parvidens, and within the ranges of C. ludovicianus, C. leucurus, and C. gunnisoni, which collectively serve as the habitat for the endangered black-footed ferret. The disease causes periodic and sometimes dramatic die-offs of prairie dogs, indirectly affecting the ferrets' welfare through reduction of prey biomass. A ten-year decline in C. leucurus colonies supporting the last free-ranging wild ferrets has left only a remnant population unsuitable for ferret reintroduction. Multiple deaths of black-footed ferrets at the Pueblo Army Depot due to ingestion of plague-contaminated prairie dog meat highlighted an additional direct hazard of plague to ferrets. The black-footed ferret captive breeding program is now producing surplus animals for reintroduction into native habitat. Plague is present at most actual and potential reintroduction sites, although a few sites in South Dakota are presently plague-free. To rate and prioritize reintroduction sites, it has become imperative for managers to have an understanding of this important disease. Also critically important is an evaluation of methods for managing the disease on prairie dog systems.Although epizootics of plague that cause high mortality of prairie dogs over wide areas are a commonly noted phenomenon, plague may be enzootically maintained between the epizootics (as opposed to the hypothesis of maintenance of the disease by continued movement of the organism from community to community). Enzootic plague may pose a direct hazard to reintroduced ferret populations and may limit populations of prairie dogs and other rodents. This study is directed toward gaining further understanding of the ecology of plague during periods between epizootic outbreaks of the disease in prairie dogs. If enzootic plague is depressing populations of small mammals, an ambitious effort to remove plague may allow increased population densities to develop over a several year period. This study is proposed to encompass 5 consecutive years, and will attempt to reduce the incidence of plague (or eliminate it) from test areas by reducing the population of fleas which transmit the disease. Initial objectives of this study are to assess efficacy, longevity, and cost of flea control using deltamethrin delivered as dust within burrows and to measure population responses of prairie dogs and associated mammals. Development of additional methods of plague control will add new potential dimensions to the study. Most promising are a recombinant vaccine for plague, and insect growth regulators (IGRs) that interrupt growth or reproductive cycles of fleas. The IGRs are somewhat more attractive than pyrethroids for large scale applications because they should be more target-specific if they can be administered directly to prairie dogs and other rodents via baits. The vaccine directly targets plague in rodents, with little chance of altering the community of arthropods in the prairie dog ecosystem. Study designs incorporating both the vaccine and flea control methods will allow distinguishing between effects of parasites and plague itself.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology I. Effects of flea control on target speciesA. Experimental Design and Data collection:  There will be 4 dusted and 4 control areas of 25-50 ha at each study site. The primary treatments will be repeated in pairs (dusted and non-dusted). A synthetic pyrethroid will be applied to prairie dog burrows with pressurized dust applicators once per year. Fleas will be collected by combing all captured prairie dogs other small mammals. Visual counts of prairie dogs will be conducted on 9-ha plots for 3 days at least once per year. Fifteen to forty prairie dogs will be radio-tagged on selected 9-ha visual count plots to document causes of mortality. Status of radio-tagged prairie dogs will be checked daily. Small mammal populations on some prairie dog colonies will be estimated via mark-recapture on trap webs. Animals will be individually marked with passive integrated transponders. Blood samples will be collected from prairie dogs and other small mammals during capture-recapture sessions. All fleas collected by combing will be tested for presence of Yersinia pestis. Blood and flea samples will be sent to CDC to test for plague using fluorescent antibody, passive hemagglutination, bacterial culture, and molecular techniques as appropriate.B. Statistical analyses: A repeated measures multivariate linear model will be used to compare flea counts among primary treatments. Covariates will be year, month, study site, and sex and species of host. Small mammal densities for each species will be using distance-based methods. Repeated measures multivariate linear modeling will be used to compare primary treatments, and to assess influences of year, season, study site, species, and predator exclusion. Daily visual counts of prairie dogs will provide indices of prairie dog population size. The measure used for statistical analysis will be the mean count for 3 consecutive days. Repeated measures multivariate linear modeling will be used to compare populations for primary treatments and to assess influences of year, season, study site, species, and predator exclusion. Prairie dog survival will be estimated using deaths per radio-day, derived from daily monitoring of radio-tagged prairie dogs during May-October.II. Effects of flea control on non-target arthropodsA. Experimental design and data collection: We will use pitfall traps constructed of nested plastic cups and funnels, inserted with tops at ground level situated near the center of each treatment area with traps at 15-m intervals on 225-m transects. We will collect arthropods from traps every day for 3 days, and preserve them in alcohol. Sweep net sampling will be done along transect lines that contain pitfall traps, sweeping over the surface of the vegetation, while slowly walking along the transect. We will remove arthropods at least once per transect (depending on the numbers of captures) and preserve them in alcohol. We will record counts of arthropods captured (by numbered species, but not necessarily identified to the level of species or genus) within each taxon (usually identified to family) in treatment and in control areas, and label with date, site, treatment, and transect number and observer.B. Statistical analyses: Comparisons will emphasize dusted and non-dusted sites (treatment versus control). We will evaluate the overall effect of deltamethrin using omnibus tests of overall species diversity and collective abundance. For species diversity, we will reduce the dataset to a simple tally of species for each plots. A Wilcoxon test of paired differences for each species will be used on  pitfall and net data. For each species, counts of individuals captured will be compared for treatment and control plots with Chi-square tests using pooled data from all study sites. We will use Friedman's non-parametric ANOVA for screening of individual species, and alpha = 0.10 to assess significance.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Approximately 1 year post-treatment, flea counts per animal remained significantly lower on dusted and than on non-dusted plots. The proportion of Peromyscus spp. with fleas was significantly lower in dusted plots (4%) compared to non-dusted plots (27%) when data from Kennedy Wash and Tom Best Spring (see below) were combined. Apparently, Peromyscus become treated with the flea powder when they enter prairie dog burrows. Because some Peromyscus populations are partially resistant to plague, these mice are considered a potential \"reservoir\" for Yersinia pestis. Thus, the ability to control fleas on both Peromyscus and Cynomys with the same burrow treatment may be significant in attempts to manage the disease. Our results suggest deltamethrin is an improvement over former flea control products used on prairie dog colonies. Deltamethrin was re-applied to burrows in the \"treatment\" plots during late summer and early fall.At the Kennedy Wash site, plague was detected in fleas (both dusted and non-dusted plots) and in 2 radio-tagged white-tailed prairie dogs that had died (both on the non-dusted plot). Evidence of plague in the non-dusted (northeast) plot at the Rail site was in the form of 2 seropositive PDs (1:128, 1:256). Other documented mortalities on Coyote Basin study areas suggests prairie dog deaths due to shooting, black-footed ferrets, and other predators.For Utah prairie dogs, a noteworthy result was the detection at the Tom Best Spring site of 19 prairie dogs seropositive for plague, with titers as high as 1:4096. Seropositive prairie dogs have been rare in former studies, and this high rate (70% of adults) is remarkable. The phenomenon stimulates thinking in several directions, including microevolution of resistance and future directions our research could take. A study of the effects of deltamethrin on non-target arthropods in Utah involved 2,009 pitfall days and 32,410 sweeps of a sweep net, which resulted in collection of 87,969 individual arthropods of 289 species in 3 classes, 21 orders and 89 families.  An exploratory analysis by species suggested that 5 species collected by sweep nets and 8 species collected by pitfalls warrant further attention.  Seven of these 13 species were more abundant on the dusted than on the non-dusted plots.  The number of sites sampled and the large number of arthropods collected should have rendered this experiment sufficiently powerful to detect dramatic influences of deltamethrin on the arthropods of these prairie dog communities. Thus, dusting prairie dog burrows once per year with 4 grams of deltamethrin does not appear to cause overall devastation of the arthropod community but may reduce certain non target species (especially burrow dwelling forms). Dusting, however, also may result in increases in some arthropods through influences on their predators or parasitoids.There is not enough room in this box to summarize new key findings.

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Drs. Tom O'Shea and Paul Cryan initiated a collaboration with virologists interested in coronaviruses in bats. Bat coronaviruses are now thought to be the origin of the global SARS outbreak in humans, but thus far have only been found in Asian bats. During 2006 O'Shea provided virologists at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center with a small number of fecal samples from two common species of Colorado bats following, resulting in the first detection of this group of viruses in bats in the Western Hemisphere.

      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED SSP: Measuring the Effects of West Nile Virus on Wild American kestrel Populations in Colorado\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem THIS FORT PROJECT/TASK IS A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH EFFORT WITH USGS NATIONAL WILDLIFE HEALTH CENTER (Project No. 2300-9U913)Since West Nile Virus (WNV) was discovered in the United States in the New York City area in 1999, the disease has spread among bird populations in 44 continental states and five Canadian provinces.  While the exact mechanism for the expansion of this disease among wild avian populations is unknown, it is thought that migratory birds play a significant role in this process.  To determine to what extent birds are actively transmitting this disease, migratory passerines are currently being monitored for the occurrence and movement of WNV in the United States.  However, these expanded efforts to monitor passerines have left other WNV-susceptible avian groups, such as raptors, less actively monitored.  This situation was exacerbated in 2002 by reports of die-offs of raptors in the Midwest related to WNV (C. Dwyer, Ohio Division of Wildlife, email communication), indicating that this bird group, like corvids, may be highly susceptible to the disease.  However, the potential impacts of WNV on wild raptor populations are currently unknown.  Concerns related to the loss of these top predators within their ecosystems, the threat of further spread of WNV by long-distance migrating raptors (such as Swainsons hawk), and the potential threat to raptor species of special concern (such as peregrine falcons and bald eagles), warrant further study and monitoring to better assess the level of occurrence and potential effects of WNV on wild raptor populations in the United States.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Kestrels will be trapped within their nest boxes or by using standard bal-chatri traps, pole traps, or noose carpets.  Once captured, birds will be banded with standard USFWS aluminum bands, collect approximately 1.0 cc or less of whole blood, take cloacal and or oropharyngeal swabs, and release the bird at the capture site.  Blood samples will be centrifuged, fractionated, frozen, and brought to the USGS National Wildlife Health Center for WNV determinations.  Cloacal and oral swabs will be put into viral transport media and frozen.  Raptor blood and swab samples will be tested to determine WNV status (virus positive, antibody positive and titer, virus and antibody negative) using an epitope blocking WNV ELISA, and rtPCR.  To address the potential effects of WNV specifically on kestrel populations, we will collect data on chick survival, brood survival, nest success, survival of hatch-year birds, and survival of adult (after-hatch year) birds.  Because this study is observational in nature, no experimental manipulation (other than the use of nest boxes) is planned, and the outcomes that we observe will be dependent on the natural WNV infection of American kestrels in the wild.  By obtaining serum, oral and cloacal swab samples from all the birds in this study, we can compare the survival of WNV-infected individuals against the survival of uninfected individuals within the same population.  Additionally, if maternal antibodies are passed to chicks, or individuals survive initial infection, we can also measure survival of antibody- protected individuals when they are challenged naturally with virus.In future phases of this project, we will use alternate marking methods (such as color bands and mortality-sensor transmitters) to permit easier identification/location and survival estimates of kestrels.  New kestrel nest box colonies may also have to be established to augment the number of boxes currently in place.  Standard monthly roadside surveys may be initiated to assess raptor numbers and associated habitat use.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources - Evaluate the status of plant and animal species at risk and provide scientific guidance for their conservation and management.To assess the potential impact of WNV on raptor populations in Colorado, we intend to use the American kestrel (Falco sparverius)populations using currently established nest box colonies (at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal NWR and locations in northern Colorado)as a surrogate sentinel species.The objectives of this study are: 1) determine where kestrel nest box colonies have been established along the Front Range and assess their current level of use; 2) capture, band, and WNV tissue sample any nestlings/adults still actively using these nests; 3) actively trap, band and WNV tissue sample any adults and fledged juveniles found along these nest box routes and 4) begin monitoring the reproductive success of these individuals (both infected and uninfected) using nest boxes as a means of assessing the potential impact of WNV on reproductive success and survival of kestrels.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Primary data on the prevalence of WNV in raptors along the Front Range of Colorado will be analyzed using established procedures and protocols for disease monitoring programs conducted by the USGS National Wildlife Health Center; additional population data will be collated and analyzed jointly by USGS Fort Collins Science Center and the USGS National Wildlife Health Center.  Principal investigators will be responsible for maintaining all data generated by this project.  Information relating to this project will be deposited in the FORT SHFI Program, the NWHC, and metadata will be prepared and served through the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII).Laboratory analysis for the prevalence of WNV among raptors in Colorado will be analyzed by USGS National Wildlife Health Center; population data will be analyzed jointly by USFWS Rocky Mountain Arsenal NWR, USGS Fort Collins Science Center, and USGS National Wildlife Health Center.  Primary users of this information will be project research partners and Federal, state, and local agencies.  Presentations, journal publications, and interim and final project reports (which will include recommendations on the application of these results to FWS management needs) will be made available to research partners and interested management agencies.These data will provide additional information on the occurrence and potential impacts of WNV on wild raptor populations.  Currently, no banding programs are known to be monitoring WNV in wild raptor populations.  The establishment of this program would enable researchers to assess the threat of WNV to raptors in the wild, and monitor changes in Colorado raptor populations that may be related to the impact of this disease.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Despite changes in the number of nests monitored within each area and alteration of brood sizes at RMA (due to the removal of one egg from each completed clutch), breeding activity in our study areas were comparable between 2004-06 field seasons.  The total number of breeding adults captured was similar within each year, with a return rate/recapture of adults between breeding seasons of 14% for females and 36% for males (as more of our marked birds were identified).  The total number of eggs laid was higher in 2005, but total number of chicks hatching and fledging was very similar between years (although these values were altered by the egg removals at RMA).  Although none of the kestrels sampled in these 3 years of this study tested positive for live WN virus, we are seeing changes in the WNV antibody titers between seasons.  On average, adult antibody titered dropped between 2004 to 2006, suggesting an increase in individual kestrels within the breeding population that have not been previously exposed to WNV.  However, given the short timespan of our study, it is difficult to determine at this time whether these antibody changes represent a real impact of the disease, overall turnover in the adult breeding population, or mixing of the breeding population among resident and migrant individuals from different locations.Among chicks, the number of broods testing positive for WNV antibodies increased from 2004 to 2006.  However, this increase may be more related to changes in our efforts to collect serum samples earlier in the chick-rearing cycle (<10 days of age) to better determine whether maternal antibody transfer is occurring, and therefore these results are an indication of detecting this antibody transfer rather than infections occurring during the chick-rearing period.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle NSF/NIH: Understanding the role of bats as reservoirs of rabies viruses\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Most human cases of rabies in the United States are of bat origin.  This task investigates the ecology of rabies transmission in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) that live in buildings used by humans.  It builds on field and laboratory work from a previous task (2001-2006)that was a cooperative study with CDC and Colorado State University.  The cooperative study determined factors involved in rabies exposure and transmission in these bats, molecular variants of the rabies virus, and variables of importance to bats in selecting roosts.  The purpose of this new task is to complete the data analysis and manuscript writing stemming from the previously completed data collection and modeling.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology This phase of the project will involve various levels of analysis, from descriptive summary statistics to hypothesis testing and stochastic and deterministic modeling.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources-Provide the Scientific Foundation for the Conservation of Terrestrial Plants, Wildlife, and Habitats by developing the basic biological information that partners need to formulate adaptive management strategies for wildlife resources.  Specific thrusts include wildlife disease ecology. Objectives of this task are to complete analysis and manuscripts related to the epidemiology and population level effects of rabies, an emerging zoonotic disease of bats that live comensally with humans in their homes and buildings.  Manuscripts to be targeted include: big brown bat antirabies serology; genetic variation in bats in relation to ecology; distribution, and rabies variant exposure; ectoparasitism and rabies exposure in bats; population dynamics of the study population, including survival and reproduction; general ecology of bats in the urbanizing study area; and mathematical modeling of the bat-rabies system.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Results will be communicated via publications in scientific journals.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings We located maternity colonies of big brown bats in about 100 buildings in Fort Collins. Logistic regression analyses coupled with AIC model selection procedures show that the most important variables in bat selection of these buildings as maternity roosts include building height, area of the opening, internal temperature, and distance to other known roosts. In autumn bats migrate to roosts in rock crevices at higher elevations for winter hibernation.  Selection of rock crevices used for these roosts was also quantified. Changes in the temporal distribution of over 1,000 bat-human encounters obtained from public health records matches features of the annual cycle of the bat population.  Encounters are rare in winter months, but peak the 3rd week in July.  This coincides with the period when juveniles are weaned.For host population dynamics and disease studies we PIT tagged and released over 4,000 big brown bats. We collected several thousand blood samples and saliva swabs. We also deployed PIT tag readers at multiple roost.  Birth occurs once annually.  Great year-to-year similarity in timing of birth, lactation, and weaning suggests an environmental buffering of the urban bat population by artificial roosts, impoundments, and watering and fertilization of planted vegetation.  Litter size is 1.1.  Age at first reproduction for most females is 1, but 30%defer reproduction until age 2.  Analyses of survival using PIT-tagged bats have been encouraging. Thus far we have evaluated the impacts of our sampling techniques on survival. We found no difference in CJS estimates of apparent survival in radiotagged and PIT tagged versus PIT-tagged-only bats, verifying for the first time that the widely used technique of radio-tagging has no major impacts on long-term survival of bats.  We also determined that anesthesia and bleeding has no effect on short-term 14 day survival or in annual survival. We also modeled movements as transition state probabilities.  Results of analyses to date suggest that movements of bats among roosts depends on scope of daily temperature change and to a lesser extent degree of infestation with mites of the genus Steatonyssus.  Understanding the ecology of rabies transmission in our study population will require estimation of various transition-state probabilities that may influence possible contact among bats. Laboratory work by collaborators at CSU and CDC in Atlanta involved completing virological studies of rabies virus from bats in Colorado; investigating seroprevalence of antibodies to rabies in our bat colonies using the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT); examining saliva swabs by RT-PCR to screen for rabies virus in free-flying bats; developing facilities and protocols for rabies exposure experiments in captive bats to aid in interpretation of results from field sampling; and ancillary studies.  Results show a high seroprevalence to rabies and an apparent ability to acquire immunity to this disease, usually considered fatal in  mammals. Genetic characterization of rabies virus variants circulating in Colorado was completed by colleagues at CDC. No bat viruses segregated with terrestrial rabies variants, and most species of bats had distinct virus variants.  However, we also found evidence of active inter-species rabies transmission in Colorado, including spillover from bats to domestic and terrestrial wildlife species within Colorado.  The capstone of our efforts is the development of a model for rabies transmission in colonial bats that roost in buildings.  This model, based on a Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Resistant mechanistic approach, was published in 2011.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments Field work for the study was conducted in summers 2001-2005 in Fort Collins Colorado, chosen because of its logistical attributes and representativeness in being dominated by colonies of big brown bats in an area of sprawling development. The local bat community has been categorized, and locations of over 150 buildings occupied by bats have been determined and characterized.  Multiple colonies of bats have been sampled, with many of these monitored for use by bats using PIT tag readers.  We have captured over 6,738 bats (9,725 times including hand recaptures), and 4,120 individual big brown bats have been marked with PIT tags. Techniques have been developed for anesthesia and sampling blood and saliva of bats, and hundreds of samples taken and analyzed from bats captured and released at roosts. Our findings based on serology and monitoring individual histories of bats with PIT tag readers at roost entrances suggest that bats acquire immunity to rabies.  Sampling bats of other species and at other locations as well as controlled experiments in captivity help confirm this hypothesis.Rabies virus strains circulating in bats of Colorado have also been characterized using molecular genetic techniques. The existence of two genetic forms of big brown bat based on mtDNA haplotypes, one eastern and one western, have been discovered in about equal proportions in Fort Collins, adding to the potential complexities of disease transmission patterns.  Overwintering habits based on reverse upslope migrations to higher elevations in the Rockies for hibernation in scattered rock crevices has been discovered. Attributes of buildings selected as maternity roosts and rock crevices selected in autumn have been determined using logistic regression and AIC model selection procedures.Modeling of the bat rabies transmission has been completed and a manuscript on this topic is under consideration by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.As of July 2010 we have published one book chapter and 19 journal articles as a result of this study. Three M.S. theses and two Ph.D. dissertation were completed.  Numerous presentations have been made at local, national, and international scientific meetings. We anticipate  production of final manuscripts in 2010 or early 2011. Three manuscripts are currently under review at journals as of July 2010.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Ecological investigations of White-Nose Syndrome in bats\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) is a devastating disease that threatens the survival of hibernating bats in North America.  Since first documented in the winter of 2005/2006, WNS has spread from a very small area of New York across at least two thousand kilometers and 26 states and 5 Canadian provinces. Over five million bats are estimated to have died during the past 9 winters after contact with WNS, and all 4 federally listed endangered species and subspecies of hibernating cave bats are in harms way. The sudden and widespread mortality associated with WNS is completely unprecedented in hibernating bats and it is not anticipated that their populations will recover quickly, if at all.  An additional 19 species of hibernating cave bats occur in the United States and, considering available information, all are potentially susceptible.  WNS is named for the ubiquitous presence of a newly identified species of cold-loving fungus (Pseudogynmnoascus destructans) that is capable of penetrating and infecting the skin and wing membranes of bats during hibernation. It is critical that research efforts directed toward WNS incorporate the expertise of scientists familiar with the ecology of bats and hibernation physiology.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Objective 1 (research coordination and technical support): Continue to represent USGS in the broader investigation into WNS by maintaining communication with bat specialists in other federal and state agencies, as well as academic partners and non-governmental organizations.  Participate in efforts to develop a federal strategic plan for responding to WNS.   Continue to provide technical support on aspects of bat ecology to staff at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center and others in the scientific and resource management communities.   Objective 2 (behavioral mechanisms of bat mortality): Conduct field investigations of behaviors influencing WNS mortality. Establish new methods for observing natural behaviors of bats inside hibernacula. Develop and deploy remote video surveillance systems inside caves and mines where bats hibernate. Compare behaviors of hibernating bats before and after arrival of the fungus P. destructans. Assess efficacy of video monitoring as early warning system for resource management.Objective 3 (physiological mechanisms of bat mortality): Conduct research into the physiological processes involved in mortality of bats infected by P. destructans.  Develop field and theoretical methods for investigating physiological disruption caused by the fungus (e.g., water and electrolyte balance, gas exchange, and circulation), and for exploring how environmental conditions influence species and continental differences in susceptibility to WNS.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources:  Research in to causative agents and control of emerging diseases and research of wildlife as a transmission vector for environmental disease.  Research support to DOI bureaus in the management and mitigation responsibilities for trust lands, species and priority ecosystems.There are 3 primary objectives to this project:1) Continue to help coordinate research efforts directed toward white-nose syndrome at a national level and provide technical support on aspects of bat ecology to USGS researchers and others in the scientific and resource management community.2) Assess the possible behavioral mechanisms by which skin infection from the causative fungus specifically acts to cause bat mortality.3) Assess the possible physiological mechanisms by which skin infection from the causative fungus specifically acts to cause bat mortality.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Continue to represent USGS and the broader research effort into WNS through participation in meetings, publications, information products, and presentations at professional conferences.  All PI generated digital and hardcopy data will be housed at the USGS Fort Collins Science Center and reports will be submitted to the appropriate USGS and USFWS offices upon request. Metadata will be served on the NBII Metadata Clearinghouse.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings There is now strong evidence that the fungus Pseudogynmnoascus destructans is an exotic/invasive species experiencing ecological release in new ecosystems. Based on recently completed and ongoing studies at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center and other laboratories, the cold-loving fungus is now considered the primary causative agent of WNS.  However, the disease etiology is unusual because it likely involves the fungus causing aberrant behaviors or disruptions in the unique physiology of wintering bats, rather than typical pathological effects, such as organ failure. Collaboration between USGS disease specialists and bat ecologists is helping bridge gaps in understanding that allow us to rapidly make progress in better addressing this unprecedented disease.  The novel video surveillance systems developed by USGS researchers and their partners for deployment in bat hibernation sites are functioning well over entire winters and allowing new types of data to be collected.  Video data resulting from this work are beginning to reveal the previously undocumented behaviors of hibernating bats and are offering insight into how fungal infection changes hibernation behaviors in several species affected by WNS.  Distributional modeling of WNS mortality framed new hypotheses of disease etiology that can now be tested through additional studies.  Physiological studies have documented electrolyte depletion in WNS bats and led to support of the USGS-formulated hypothesis that dehydration plays a major role in the susceptibility of bats to P. destructans.  Ongoing mathematical modeling is revealing that humidity of bat hibernacula likely has a major influence on the susceptibility of certain species and may possibly explain why European bats are less susceptible to fungal infection.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED NPS: Development of a written reference notebook on plague for NPS\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Plague is an exotic and potentially fatal zoonotic disease. Since its introduction to the U.S. around 1900, at least 25 NPS units in 3 regions have reported evidence of plague in wildlife. Within the last 18 months, 2 NPS units have conducted investigations of human plague cases. Although management to protect humans and wildlife from plague has been conducted in some NPS units, there is currently no service-wide plague managementguidance document.   In May 2008, the NPS One Health steering committee identified plague as a priority disease for which acoordinated Servicewide plan was lacking, and created a working group to address the issue. The workinggroup was tasked with developing a document that incorporated information about plague biology, ecology, andmanagement into a set of standard operating procedures (SOP) that could be implemented by NPS units currently or potentially exposed to plague. Each member of the working group was asked to write a chapter or chapters pertaining to some aspect of plague biology or ecology, based on their professional knowledge of plague, and based on a thorough investigation of plague literature.   Members of the plague working group met during a two-day workshop held 19-20 May 2009 in Fort Collins,Colorado, to begin the process of synthesizing the information each member had compiled. Attendees included representatives from the NPS Office of Public Health, Risk Management Program, Pacific West Region, Intermountain Region, Midwest Region, and Biological Resource Management Division. USGS-BRD was asked to participate to provide additional technical expertise. Objectives of facilitated discussions during the workshop were to: 1) document current plague management activities in parks; 2) assess if review of and compliance for plague plans are sufficient; 3) develop a system of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for determining lead responsibilities, and; 4) discuss best management practices for responses to plague.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle White-nose Syndrome (WNS) Specimen Tracking System\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem During the winter of 2006/2007, an affliction of unknown origin dubbed White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) began devastating colonies of hibernating bats in a small area around Albany, New York. Colonies of hibernating bats were reduced > 80% at the affected caves and mines that were surveyed.  Since then, WNS has been detected more than 1,000 kilometers (620 mi) away from the original site, and has infected bats in ten surrounding states.  Most species of bats that hibernate in the region are now known to be affected but little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), northern long-eared bats (M. septentrionalis), and federally listed (endangered) Indiana bats (M. sodalis) have been hit particularly hard.  The sudden and widespread mortality associated with WNS is unprecedented in hibernating bats, which differ from most other small mammals in that their survival strategy is to live life in the slow lanetheir life history adaptations include high rates of survival and low fecundity, resulting in low potential for population growth.  Most of the affected species are long lived (~5-15 years or more) and have only one offspring per year.  Populations of bats affected by WNS will, therefore, not recover quickly.Region 5 is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) lead on WNS and needs to get timely information on the spread and impact of WNS. To get this information, the USFWS is working with partner agencies and analysis laboratories to obtain, manage, and distribute data collected and assessed under common methodologies and protocols. The most effective strategy for implementing these critical methods and protocols across agencies and organizations is through a single, secure, Web-based data support system. Data support systems are effective because they can centralize all partner data in a single repository and enforce the approved data integrity standards while allowing users to input, verify, and report on their data remotely using a secure internet connection.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology To support the WNS Specimen Tracking effort, FORT will work with the USFWS to develop a Web-based, geospatially oriented, data support system for tracking specimens from the point of collection through analysis. This system will provide users a way to enter site characteristics for collected data, track the progress of the analysis process, receive and distribute completed analyses results to partners, sequester secure data for agency or group access only, and summarize and map resultant data.This effort will require close cooperation between FORT, the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, USFWS biologists, and academic institutions such as Cornell University. The lead FORT scientist will act as liaison with these groups and the applications development effort. The FORT Web Applications Team will work with the FORT scientist to implement the agreed upon data protocols and workflow. In addition, FORT will provide application hosting through September 30, 2011, which will include technical support and user assistance for data management, as well as technical documentation in the event USFWS Region 5 should need to port the application to another hosting platform in the future.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The USGS Fort Collins Science Center (FORT) will provide technical assistance to the USFWS Region 5 to construct a geospatially oriented data support system for tracking information on WNS specimens (e.g., carcasses, tissues), from collection through analysis. This support system will help USFWS receive timely information on the spread and dynamics of WNS. The specific goals of the project include:1) Provide a central repository for nationwide bat specimen analyses based on the data collection and analysis standards provided by USFWS Region 5 and the relevant WNS data standards working group;2) Provide a secure Web-based data input system for WNS specimen collection data from State and Federal agencies, Tribal and land managers, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations;3) Provide a secure Web-based data input system for reporting lab analysis results of WNS specimen samples;4) Provide wildlife managers and researchers with near real-time access to WNS data and other critical information, including available specimens, test results, seasonality of disease effects, geospatial analyses of WNS and bat distribution patterns, and partner-developed forecasts of potential risk areas;5) Establish data access security protocols and data sharing/confidentiality agreements, to ensure the protection and appropriate use of sensitive data.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan USGS project leads will communicate with partners in the FWS and other diagnostic labs on a monthly basis during initial development and design of the system.  This communication will include site visits, but mostly occur by telephone, email, or WebEx.  Progress updates will be provided to FWS and other partners upon request and the end product of the project will be available online by the project completion date.Schedule:Project Initiation - Publication of the WNS specimen data dictionary+90 days - Working prototype of WNS Specimen Tracking application will be available to a defined user group, including documentation of workflow(s), and database and application functionality.  +180 days - Based on user groups inputs, refine and release application to all users.9/30/2011 - Report on WNS Specimen Tracking System use and user needs assessment.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The WNS tracking system has been fully developed and tested by a small group of state resource managers.  The system was refined based on their feedback and is ready for wider deployment. Additional state resource managers will begin populating the database as we move toward making it public and integrating it with the Bat Population Data (BPD) Project in the coming year.During the summer of 2013, a student contractor was hired to help with the Bat Population Data (BPD) Project and the WNS tracking system.

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease responsible for unprecedented mortality in hibernating bats in the northeastern U.S.  This previously unrecognized disease has spread very rapidly since its discovery in January 2007, and poses a considerable threat to hibernating bats throughout North America.  As WNS spreads, the challenges for understanding and managing the disease continue to increase.  In June 2008, an effort to formalize a coordinated approach for addressing WNS was initiated among Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense (DoD), and State wildlife management agencies.  A National Plan for Assisting States, Federal Agencies,and Tribes in Managing White-Nose Syndrome in Bats was developed (USFWS 2011). This plan provides a framework that outlines the actions necessary to coordinate Federal and State efforts and identifies actions in support of State, Federal, Tribal, and partner WNS management efforts. Seven elements were identified in the plan and each would be administered by a working group responsible for the coordination of activities within that element.   The purpose of one such working group, the Data and Technical Information Management working group, is to provide a mechanism for making WNS information accessible in a timely fashion to all entities involved with the investigation and management of WNS. The primary activities of the working group are to desseminate information about WNS by providing access to common scientific and technical information in a partner-based data system; working with States to create data standards that will allow inter-operability with existing WNS data sets; providing researchers and wildlife managers with real-time access to WNS data and other critical information; and ultimately, integrating WNS data from State and Federal agencies and others into a more structured national database thereby allowing analysis to be conducted on a continental basis.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Leadership and coordination of the DMWG involves organizing and participating in conference calls to discuss national bat database needs and WNS issues, participating in other working group's discussions about database needs, attending the annual WNS Symposium, providing demonstrations of the Bat Population Data (BPD) Project and the WNS Disease Tracking System at meetings and workshops, writing and collaborating on proposals, preparing budgets for funding opportunities, and discussing national bat monitoring program ideas.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle NRPP Investigating the transmission of plague by small mammals at Badlands NP\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Plague was first detected in the southwest corner of Badlands National Park (BADL), and spread northeastward, reaching the northeast corner in 2011. Multiple prairie dog colonies in BADL and Conata Basin have had population collapses from plague since its arrival in the park. Plague is now common throughout BADL (NPS and USFS, unpublished data), and threatens efforts to preserve and manage the federally endangered black-footed ferret in BADL, which were reintroduced into the park in 1994. Although plague management in BADL and elsewhere has specifically targeted black-footed ferrets and prairie dogs, this disease is transmitted within a larger community of small mammals.  This study will serve as an exploratory effort to gain insight into which species of small mammals and their fleas are primary participants in the plague cycle, which are secondary participants, which are bystanders that might be affected, and which are non-participants.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will conduct a field experiment based on a randomized complete block design to investigate whether small mammals are chronically affected by enzootic levels of plague and which are potential hosts that may function as short-term reservoirs in the flea-borne transmission of plague in black-tailed prairie dog colonies and surrounding environments in BADL. Our study will encompass a minimum of 6 consecutive months in 2 randomly selected paired dog colonies (study sites) that experienced an epizootic plague outbreak in 2011-2012.  Within the two colonies, we will utilize 3 experimental treatment groups on 2.25-ha plots.  One plot will recieve deltamethrin insecticide applications to control the fleas that are vectors for plague, all animals will be vaccinated with an experimental plague vaccine on a second plot, and the third plot will not be treated.  We will capture and mark small mammals on all plots on a monthly basis.  Survival during the resulting 5 intervals (based on 6 trapping sessions) will be analyzed for each species via multiple logistic regression and Cormack-Jolly-Seber models in program MARK.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives 1.Determine the role of small mammal species in maintenance of enzootic plague.2.Determine whether small mammal species harbor fleas that carry the bacterium (Y. pestis) and function as short-term reservoir hosts of plague.3.Assess efficacy and longevity of deltamethrin insecticide for plague vector control on small mammals.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan A publication will be prepared at the end of theis single-season study summarizing involvement of each small mammal species captured in the plague cycle as inferred from differences in survival rates among the 3 treatments.  Also, park managers will be kept apprised of progress through monthly oral communications.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings On the first grassland study site selected, only 1 mouse (a deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus) was captured during 1,500 trap nights of effort.  Due to that record-setting lack of success, the site was abandoned. There was evidence for presence of plague in populations of hispid pocket mice and grasshopper mice in habitats away from active prairie dog colonies.  A possible direct effect of deltamethrin on deer mice may be masking our ability to detect effects of plague for that species.  For future studies of these small mammal species, we propose using a bait station approach for flea control instead of burrow dusting.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments Initial trapping of small mammals was hindered by unseasonal snow storms in April.  Trapping was delayed until early May.  A wet summer also impeded progress at tiems, but trapping continued through the end of October.  The project was again hammpered in October by another record blizzard and by the shutdown of the federal government.The project was visited by National Public Radio in Ausust, and a story about enzootic plague was aired in October on \"All Things Considered.\"  A second story on black-footed ferret recovery will be aired on \"Morning Edition.\"\n",

Proportionally few scientists specializing in the ecology of bats had disease research experience prior to the recent eruption of interest in bat zoonoses (diseases that originate in wildlife but `spill over to humans), creating an atmosphere of great uncertainty and a need for disease-specific bat expertise.  For more than a decade FORT scientists have played key roles in collaborating with other researchers to study diseases in wild bats (e.g., rabies and coronaviruses).  These collaborations facilitated broader subsequent efforts, such as helping to establish the causes of white-nose syndrome when the disease first emerged, as well as helping to develop a better understanding of the roles bats play in the evolution of emerging infectious diseases.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Surveillance for WNS by examining bacteria and fungi of bats\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Since the winter of 2006-2007, white-nose syndrome (WNS) has spread north, south and west from Albany, New York, killing hibernating bats as it continues to move westward.  At present Pseudogymnoascus destructans, a fungus likely from Europe and causal agent of WNS, and the disease itself have been documented as far west as western Missouri and Arkansas, near the eastern Oklahoma border. Current research has established that several caves in El Malpais National Monument (ELMA), New Mexico possess appropriate microclimate conditions for the growth of P. destructans.In related research, Dr. Northup at the University of New Mexico has found that naturally occurring bacteria and fungi on the surfaces of bats wings and fur vary among bat species. In addition, some bat species have a preponderance of Actinobacteria, the bacterial phylum from which two-thirds of naturally occurring antibiotics come from.  Dr. Northup is currently testing Actinobacteria cultured from twelve different bat species against P. destrucans to determine if these bat Actinobacteria may serve as a natural defense against P. destructans.  It is believed that the western bats microbiota composition may give clues as to the differences in vulnerability to WNS observed in eastern bat species that have been affected by WNS.  It is believed by Dr. Valdez, USGS-FORT research scientist, that the bacterial and fungal composition of different bats species is influenced by roosting habits, as well as the sex, hormone level, parasite load, and diet of each bat, all of which may be inter-connected.  Therefore, in a collaborative effort, the USGS and UNM have will conduct novel research investigates the natural occurring microbiota of bats from the western United States.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Evaluating flea resistance to insecticides and developing an integrative approach to mitigating the effects of plague on endangered black-footed ferrets.\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Plague is a widely distributed flea-borne disease that was introduced to North America ca. 1900, where it disrupts ecosystems and became a substantial threat several endangered species. We propose research that will assist in developing an integrative approach to mitigating the effects of plague on endangered black-footed ferrets. Although ferrets have been reintroduced at multiple sites, plague poses a persistent and ominous threat to ferrets at almost all of them. During the late-1990s and early-2000s, dusting of prairie dog burrows with an insecticide (deltamethrin) proved effective in controlling flea populations and protecting ferrets from plague-caused mortality. Deltamethrin ultimately became a mainstay in recovery efforts for ferrets and prairie dogs. By 2009, accumulating evidence suggested that deltamethrin was losing its effectiveness in reducing flea densities and protecting ferrets in Conata/Badlands. In particular, the ferret population was declining disproportionately faster than the prairie dog population and survival of plague-vaccinated ferrets was higher than non-vaccinated ferrets on deltamethrin-treated colonies. One possible cause of a decline in efficacy of deltamethrin is the evolution of insecticide resistance in fleas, a phenomenon observed in many flea species throughout the world. Because some colonies of prairie dogs in Conata/Badlands had been dusted for up to 10 consecutive years by 200910, and fleas may go through several generations in a single year, evolution of resistance seemed plausible.In 2013, USGS initiated a pilot study to evaluate this possibility using historic and new data the North Exclosure, a prairie dog colony treated with deltamethrin since 2005. In 2013, about 1 year after the North Exclosure was dusted with deltamethrin, flea prevalence was substantially higher than it had been at that point during 2007-09. Further, flea prevalence on the North Exclosure in 2013 was higher than on non-dusted colonies during 2007-09. Later in 2014, during the 10th year of deltamethrin treatment, flea parasitism rebounded 1 month post-treatment on the North Exclosure. Flea numbers also rebounded 1 month post-treatment in the South Exclosure, a site with a similar history of exposure to deltamethrin. Thus, upon exposure to deltamethrin, flea populations had recovered quickly, a phenomenon suggestive of insecticide resistance.To directly evaluate insecticide resistance, the USGS implemented bioassays developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2014, fleas from the two Exclosure sites and several control (no-dust) colonies were directly exposed to deltamethrin for 1 hour in Petri dishes. After 1520 minutes in the dishes, survival rates were 20% higher for fleas from the Exclosure sites, relative to fleas from control colonies. After 1 hour, all of the fleas appeared dead. The seemingly dead fleas were removed from the dishes, placed in plastic vials, and stored in a dark, cool location. About 2 days later, 23% of fleas from the Exclosures were alive and active whereas only 2% of fleas from the non-dusted colonies recovered.These results from Conata/Badlands suggest that fleas from sites with long-term exposure to deltamethrin are less sensitive to deltamethrin, and are developing knockdown resistance. That is, the fleas are temporarily paralyzed by deltamethrin but, due to a genetic mutation, can recover, rebound in abundance, and presumably once again transmit plague to mammalian hosts.Deltamethrin is used to manage plague at several ferret reintroduction sites. The risk posed by even widely spaced infectious rodent carcasses could be serious for the relatively mobile foraging ferrets that usually die upon consumption of even a single Y. pestis-infected carcass. Without continued, intensive study and identification of new tools for plague management, conservation efforts for ferrets and progress toward their recovery will almost certainly be compromised.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Research will be conducted in Conata/Badlands of South Dakota. We will continue our evaluation of flea resistance to deltamethrin by collecting fleas from live-trapped prairie dogs (Eads 2014) and conducting CDC bioassays (Ames 2011) as described above. We will attempt to sample at least 5 colonies of varying history of exposure to deltamethrin, both before and after treatment, and at least 3 control colonies that have never been treated. CDC bioassays will be analyzed using survival curves (Ames 2011). Recovery rates (i.e., post-exposure recovery) will be compared for fleas from colonies with differing histories of deltamethrin treatment and control sites.In conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service, we will evaluate the relative efficacy of alternative insecticides that, in combination with deltamethrin and the bait-delivered vaccine (SPV), may provide wildlife managers with alternative tools for plague management.The new products will be distributed in areas where deltamethrin is not used. At the same time, deltamethrin will be distributed at sites where it has been repeatedly used. The first flea survey each year will be completed just before application of the insecticides, as a pre-treatment sample. The next survey will be done 1-10 days after treatment, and another survey will be done approximately 30 days after treatment. Additional surveys will be completed 2 and 3 months post-treatment. Throughout the study, fleas will be sampled from sites with no history of insecticide treatment, providing a baseline index of flea densities. Analyses will resemble those mentioned above for the study of deltamethrin resistance.Lastly, in conjunction with the CDC, we will conduct enzyme assays (Roberts and Andre 1994) for fleas collected at sites with varying exposure to deltamethrin and fleas from sites with no insecticide exposure (the latter serving as baseline determinants). The assays quantify the level at which fleas express differing enzymes indicative of resistance to particular insecticides (e.g., -esterase and -esterase for deltamethrin; Ames 2011). Initially, we will complete enzyme assays with fleas collected from sites with 1113 years of exposure to deltamethrin and control sites that have never been treated. Fleas from the sites with long-term exposure should exhibit higher levels of -esterase and -esterase than fleas from control sites. If results from this initial trial are promising, we will test fleas collected at sites that have been treated with deltamethrin for 510 years. This second batch of enzyme assays will help us to evaluate the development of insecticide resistance in fleas over time, allowing for identification of a timestamp of resistance.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives 1.Evaluate the efficacy of new products as tools for reducing flea densities and managing plague.2.Validate tools that can be used to quickly, effectively, and cheaply determine when fleas are developing resistance to particular insecticides.3.Evaluate potential ways to alternate the use of multiple insecticides in a manner that reduces flea resistance to insecticides, and integrate these with vaccine use.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Survival Behaviors of Bats with White-nose Syndrome\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem White-nose syndrome (WNS) continues to spread through populations of hibernating bats in North America, causing unprecedented mortality in several species occurring in eastern parts of the continent. Despite this devastation, other eastern bat species that come into contact with the causative fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, somehow survive. We still do not understand factors influencing species and continental differences in bat susceptibility to WNS, but microclimate conditions in the places where bats hibernate are thought to play an important role. Temperature and humidity of hibernacula likely interact with fungal growth and bat hibernation in predictable and sometimes deadly ways. Smaller species of bats hibernating in warmer and wetter sites might be more susceptible to disease than larger species using drier and colder hibernacula. Furthermore, USGS research shows unusual winter-long hibernation arousal patterns in certain species that might help them survive WNS. Together, we believe this evidence points to the possibility of WNS 'survival habitats' and 'survival behaviors'---through this research we aim to look for them.With the major front of WNS spread now advancing past the eastern edge of the Great Plains, and a recently detected jump in detection of disease to Washington State, our ignorance about where and how most bats in western North America hibernate is in the spotlight. We know almost nothing about where most species of bats in the West go during winter, and what thermoregulatory behaviors, microclimates, and social conditions might be like in those hibernacula. At least a dozen species of hibernating bats occur only in the West and those species are not yet known to be affected by WNS. A potential doubling to tripling in the number of diseased species could occur as the fungus spreads through the West. Will WNS have the same devastating effects as it had in the East? What species will be most susceptible and which might survive? Are bat hibernacula in the West often as warm and wet as in the East? Do western species show unusual winter-long arousal patterns like species we have seen surviving in the East? These questions might be answerable if we can characterize microclimate conditions and long-term thermoregulatory patterns of bats within western hibernacula.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The novelty of our approach is that we not go through the laborious and costly step of finding the mysterious hibernation sites of western species to characterize the behaviors of bats and microclimates within.This study will occur between May 2017 and December of 2019 and focus on common species of bats with robust populations that live commensally with humans in buildings. We anticipate this study laying the groundwork for a much broader effort, beginning in 2018-2019 and to be funded separately, aimed at characterizing the hibernation habitats and behaviors of many additional non-commensal and species of greater conservation concern, both within and outside of regions where WNS has spread. We will capture and tag multiple species of hibernating bats during summers and autumns at easier-to-find summer roosts, suture miniature data logging devices to their backs, and then recapture the tagged bats and download hibernation data during the following springs and summers. Based on our prior success with this approach, we expect to be able to characterize winter microclimates and hibernation behaviors of bats without actually having to find and access their yet-to-be-discovered hibernacula.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives 1) Finish developing and testing a new generation of miniaturized (~1g) datalogging `batpacks' that bats will carry to record the temperature and relative humidity inside their winter roosts at approximately 90-minute intervals for entire winters (8-9 months). 2) Deploy several hundred prototype batpacks on 2-3 species of hibernating bats in Colorado as they leave their maternity colonies in late summer, then subsequently recapture them and retrieve hibernation data in spring.3) Characterize, mathematically model, and report on the overwintering hibernation conditions and arousal behaviors of tagged species of bats in the context of potential WNS survival habitats and behaviors.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Effects of limiting habitat relationships with regression quantiles\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Unexplained heterogeneity in statistical models of animal responses to their physical environment is reasonable to expect because the measured habitat resources are a constraint on but not the sole determinant of abundance, survival, fecundity, or fitness.  Patterns of heterogeneity often observed in data collected from observational studies designed to build or test habitat models are consistent with confounding due to interactions among multiple factors (many which are not measured), where the factor that is limiting shifts among sample locations and times.  Typically, it is impossible to know whether the habitat factors measured are actually limiting at the time and location of sampling.  Our ecological understanding and reliability of management predictions based on animal habitat models can be improved by shifting focus from estimating expected values (means) of responses to estimating intervals of responses associated with multiple percentiles of a distribution.  Regression quantiles are one easily implemented approach for estimating intervals of responses in multiple regression models of animal responses to habitat.  This methodology is a simple, useful extension of the frequentist paradigm that can be applied to a variety of ecological analyses where hidden biases may occur in observational data.  Understanding limitations on inferences and interpretations are required to facilitate ecological applications where interest may lie with extremal quantiles and sample sizes are small.  Many applications also require extension to parametric nonlinear models, including censored survival models, and nonparameteric nonlinear smoothers.  Estimation procedures exist for quantile estimation in these nonlinear models but inference procedures are poorly developed.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology (1) Model simulations are made under homogeneous and heterogeneous (3 levels) normal, uniform, and lognormal error distributions for simple and multiple regression models for five quantiles (0.50, 0.75, 0.90, 0.95,0.99), six sample sizes (20, 30, 60, 90, 150, 300), and for 5 effect sizes (including null of zero).  Predictor variables will be fixed and structured to represent values similar to those encountered in habitat studies, including various degrees of multicollinearity for multiple regression models.  One thousand random data sets are generated for each combination of conditions and the asymptotic and two permutation test statistics are evaluated for each data set.  Hypotheses tested will range from testing single parameters (intercept and slopes) in simple and multiple regression models to testing multiple parameters jointly in multiple regession models.  Probability values for permutation tests are made with 10,000 Monte Carlo resamples.  Cumulative distribution functions are compared under the null (effect size = 0) to assess type I error rates and under the four alternatives to assess power.  The first set of simulations is constructed where all variables used in the generating model are available to use in the estimating model, representing an ideal situation where the model form is known.  The second set of simulations is constructed so that some variables generating heterogeneity in the model are not available to use in the estimating model, representing a more typical situation where some amount of hidden bias is present because the correct model form is unknown.  The second set of simulations will also be constructed so that the variables in the generating model that are not available in the estimating model are spatially structured to different degrees.  The estimating model process will then be repeated where the spatial locations are incorporated in estimation and testing either through a spatial trend surface or spatial autoregressive procedure.  Note that while comparisons are being made in terms of type I error rates and power that these are directly related to confidence interval coverage and length, respectively, for intervals constructed by the test inversion approach.(2) Estimates and confidence intervals will be made for a range of quantiles following recommendations based on results of (1).  Issues related to influence of specific data values on estimates, sensitivity of predicted bounds to selected quantiles, and interpretations of potential effects based of unmeasured processes will be discussed.  This will help us understand the strengths and limitations of regression quantiles as a method for predicting animal responses to habitat.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Estimating fish body condition with quantile regression was found to provide a simple, statistically rigorous approach for comparing weigths of fish conditional on their total lengths.  The example application on walleye and white bass in Lake McConaughey, a large reservoir, using data provided by M. Porath, Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, yielded simple, intuitive statements about how conditional weights of fish changed after addition of a new prey resource.  Multiplicative differences in quantiles of weights conditional on total lenghts were found to be a more useful basis of comparison than the unitless comparisons of relative weight commonly made by fisheries scientists (and avoids the adhoc statistical approaches for estimating standard weight equations).  Our analyses of blue sucker body condition throughout the central USA provided additional details on how to parameterize quantile regression models to compare body condition and allometric growth among geographic regions. The information obtained from the comprehensive quantile estimates where allometric growth could vary both within and among locations was greater than the information obtained from mean regression models where allometric growth only varied among locations, which was greater than the information obtained from relative weight which implicitly assumed no variation in allometric growth.Extending the concepts of equivalence testing to quantile regression estimates was found to be easily accomplished via proper use of 1- or 2-tailed confidence intervals on estimates.  Relating the confidence intervals for quantile estimates to intervals of values (termed equivalence regions) has many potential application in ecology from evaluating trends in endangered species, land restoration objectives (e.g., mine land reclamation), and habitat management objectives (Comprehensive Conservation Plans at wildlife refuges). Estimating conditional quantiles of counts based on a simple modification of quantile regression for continuous responses proposed by Machado and Santos Silva (2005. JASA 100: 1226-1237) was used to evaluate Cape Sable seaside sparrow responses to water depths in Everglades National Park. Model results partially supported earlier analyses in that we demonstrated rapid multiplicative decreases in upper quantiles of counts as water depths increased from 0 to 15 cm for sites previously occupied by 1 or more sparrows in prior years.  However, we also demonstrated that this multiplicative model indicated 5-25% of sites had 1 or more sparrows even as water depths increased to 20 cm.  Comparisons were also made with conditional means and quantiles estimated from a zero-inflated Poisson regression model.  This demonstrated the advantages of estimating conditional quantiles even for a parametric count model, as well as the greater flexibility of quantile regression to estimate the conditional quantiles for arbitrary, unknwown distributions. We have continued to explore the count model possibilities with quantile regression by applying the methodology to small bounded counts (0 - 3) of spotted owl fledglings as related to climatic and landscape characteristics in the Lassen National Forest in CA (long-term data set of Barry Noon's at Colorado State University).  Our initial modeling efforts indicate that the quantile count methodology continues to work well with these small bounded counts and that the method may provide a reasonable alternative to ordinal logistic regression.  An obvious extreme of the quantile count model is to actually use the method for presence (counts >=1) and absence (counts = 0) modeling.  I have continued to explore these possibilities by reviewing appropriate literature and contacting authors for experimental software.    Earlier work and products (2006 and earlier) are under task 83279NA.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem For more than a decade, Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO) ranked research on mountain lion as a top priority, however there has been no scientific study of this species inside the parkdue largely to the high costs, difficulty, and long-term nature of research on this elusive cat.   The need for research on the parks top predator, however, has not diminished with time.  With more than 3 million visitors per year, human-mountain lion encounters are on the rise.  A fatal encounter occurred in 1997.  And recently, Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) was detected in the parks mule deer and elk populations. The role of mountain lions, a keystone predator, in controlling the spread of CWD is as yet unknown.  These compelling circumstances accentuate the need for basic research on mountain lion in ROMO and in Colorados Front Range.  This Study Plan frames an overarching 5-year research plan for mountain lion, initially focusing on eastern ROMO and research objectives shared by the Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW): (1) gather basic ecological baseline data on mountain lions in ROMO, (2) study human-mountain lion interaction, and (3) test for selective predation by mountain lion on CWD-infected mule deer.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle USGS Bat Population Data (BPD) Project\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In 1994, USGS scientists recognized that despite increasing concern for many species of bats known or believed to be declining, the data necessary to determine population status and trends were fragmented among agencies and organizations. Thus began the USGS Bat Population Data Project, which has become a multi-phase, comprehensive effort to compile existing population information for bats in the United States and Territories.  The initial phase of this project was developed to (1) synthesize the existing bat population data and publications for the United States and Territories into a single database source (Bat Population Database v.1, 2001), (2) test the utility of this data for estimating trends in bat populations, (3) evaluate the applicability of this data to design future monitoring programs, and (4) serve the database on the Internet for use by conservation and management organizations. The first Bat Population Database (BPD v.1), the projects principle product, is a relational database that compiles various components of bat population data from 1855-2001, including counts of bats at colony locations, mist net and trap capture data, location attributes, management actions, species status, and a complete bibliography of bat publications (published literature, theses and agency reports, and State agency files) for the U.S. and the U.S. Territories.In a subsequent phase, USGS partnered with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Bat Conservation International, U.S. Forest Service, and Bureau of Land Management to convene a scientific workshop for evaluating the current status of bat populations, the methods used to estimate their trends, and developing scientific goals for future monitoring programs. Participants included experts in bat biology, wildlife population monitoring, and wildlife population estimation. In 2003, the USGS Fort Collins Science Center published the results of the workshop in a USGS Information and Technology Report titled Monitoring trends in bat populations of the United States and territories: Problems and prospects (OShea and Bogan, 2003). This report includes a summary and analysis of the BPD v.1 data and its utility in guiding the design of future monitoring programs.In the years since completion of BPD v.1 and workshop report, North American bat populations have continued to decline.  Of particular concern have been the precipitous declines of hibernating bats affected by White-nose Syndrome (WNS), a novel fungal pathogen, as well as the significant threat to migrating bats from increasing wind energy development. These combined threats have generated an urgent need for data suitable for bat population estimation and trend analysis.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Development of the next version of the database, BPD v.2, began in April, 2012 with the first of two planned Beta releases occurring in June, 2012. The focus of a beta release is for a set of defined users to report any bugs or make suggestions for additional features. The initial Beta release provides users with the ability to search for bibliographic references pertaining to bat populations by various locations, date, and species- oriented search keys. Users can also perform species-oriented searches that display species distributions on maps and related species statistics and tabular data. This release also provides the ability to browse various research topics and view which partners are participating in the BPD program as well as species taxonomic data and study location. In addition to the aforementioned user functionality, the release allows BPD application managers to dynamically manage (create, edit, and delete) the bibliographic references, species taxonomic data, participating data partners , research topics, and field sites.   The second Beta release, expected in September 2012, will provide metadata and data management capabilities to BPD data partners. Partners will be able to define projects and select one or more standards-based templates that define the data to be collected for the project. Built-in templates for key areas such as colony counts and mist netting and trapping will be provided and additional custom templates can be added (and shared) by USGS scientists and data partners. Collectively the templates comprise the data form for the project. This set of templates can be exported to be used in the data collection process (conducted off-line) such that the data can be ultimately imported into BPD through manual data entry or automated upload. Once production is complete, expected in December 2012, BPD v.2 will become fully operational and replace the existing BPD v. 1. Once released, USGS Scientists and data partners will be able to conduct BPD searches, view statistics, view maps, utilize a standards-based approach for collecting, entering, and sharing data, and export data sets and reports.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Status and Trends of Biological Resources Goal 1 - Provide a framework that facilitates the integration of information from a variety of sources at multiple spatial and temporal scales to describe and track the abundance, distribution, productivity, and health of the Nations plants, animals, and ecosytems.  Currently, USGS scientists are responding to this need by upgrading, updating and extending the capabilities of BPD v.1 for better data management, accessibility and utility by USGS and data partners.  The objectives of this phase are to: Replace the existing Windows MS Access-based BPD v.1 database with a server-based BPD v.2 database that is centrally managed by USGS. Provide web-based BPD access to researchers and management/conservation organizations, thereby facilitating collaboration and data sharing between data partners.  Provide advanced search capabilities:  including new enhanced form-based searches as well as the ability to search by location by clicking on maps (spatially-oriented data search). Define standard data sets for collecting and managing data to facilitate a standards-based approach and provide a solid foundation for research. Provide USGS scientists and BPD data partners with report and export services.  Foster existing and new data partnerships with state and federal agencies.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan BPD v.2 will become fully operational and replace the existing BPD v.1 in December 2012. Once released, USGS scientists and data partners will be able to conduct searches, view statistics, view maps, utilize a standards-based approach for collecting, entering, and sharing data, and export data sets and reports.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The following highlights and key findings are for BPD v.1 (only updated to 2001):Populations of bats (Order Chiropter) are difficult to monitor.  However, current recognition of the importance of bats to biodiversity, their ecological and economic value as ecosystem components, and their vulnerability to declines makes monitoring trends in their populations a much needed cornerstone for their future management.  We developed and analyzed a national database on counts of bats at numerous locations.  Most efforts at monitoring bat populations involve use of indices that are uncalibrated in relation to population size, do not incorporate measures of variation or detectability, are discontinuous in time and space, and sometimes lack standard protocols. This is in part because the complex and variable natural history of bats poses many challenges to monitoring. A thorough summary and analysis of the data included in the USGS Bat Population Database exists in a book chapter from the proceedings of a workshop on monitoring trends in bat populations.A critical review of the U.S. Government's Bat Banding Program (1932-1972) was completed and released as an Open-File Report in 2008. More than 2 million bands were issued by the Bat Banding Program (BBP) of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) from 1932-1972. Approximately 1.5 million bands were applied to 36 species of bats by scientists, their students, and colleagues in many locations in North America including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Throughout the program, banders noticed numerous and deleterious effects on bats. This led to a moratorium on bat banding by the USFWS, and a resolution to cease banding by the American Society of Mammalogists in 1973. One of the main points of the memorandum written to justify the moratorium was to conduct a detailed evaluation of the files of the bat-banding program. These files have not been converted to an electronic database and remain only as paper files and index cards. In this critical review of the program, a detailed history of bat banding in North America is provided, including a literature review of bat banding activities, and a retrospective analysis of mark-recapture data for Townsend's big-eared bats. This retrospective analysis was published in Northwestern Naturalist in 2010.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments These accomplishments are for BPD v.1:A relational database has been developed and is being maintained and updated as new data are encountered or submitted from outside sources.  The database is over 27,000 observations at more than 6,000 locations gleaned from 1,500 publications and several other sources of data.  The strengths of these existing data were evaluated and in general found to be inadequate for rigorous interpretation of trends in population sizes.  A manuscript summarizing these findings was completed and published. A manuscript summarizing the U.S. Government's Bat Banding Program was released as an Open-File Report in 2008. A manuscript was submitted to Northwestern Naturalist and published in 2010 on the survival of Townsend's big-eared bats in Washington State.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED - Bird migration patterns in the arid southwest with Doppler Radar\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Background:  Recent literature demonstrates increasing concern within the bird conservation community regarding the importance of stopover sites and resources to en route migratory birds.  Understanding broad migratory patterns and how migrants use specific habitats during stopover is valuable to any avian conservation plan that identifies habitats important to migrants across all phases of their life cycle  breeding, brood-rearing, wintering, and migration.  In addition to natural challenges birds face during migration (e.g., high energy demands, competition, predation, severe weather), anthropogenic threats during migration include habitat loss or degradation, hazardous structures such as communication towers and wind power turbines, and global climate change.  There is a particular need to determine bird migration patterns in the desert Southwest where western migrants cross inhospitable, arid landscapes between breeding and wintering grounds.  It is known that migrants use riparian habitats for refueling during migration.  We know less about how variation in broad migratory patterns across the Southwest influences migrant density or abundance at stopover sites and how use of riparian habitats compares with use of grassland, desert, shrubland, mesquite bosque, or montane habitats during migratory stopovers.  Furthermore, biologists lack information on migrant flight altitude distributions, directions of travel, and how all these patterns vary seasonally and annually.  Justification:  This research project will address these gaps in our knowledge in support of high priority research needs identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Regions 2 (the Southwest) and 9 (headquarters) Migratory Bird Offices to identify patterns of avian migration and important stopover sites across the Southwest.  Research on migration patterns is also one of the highest priorities for the Partners in Flight (PIF) Western Region.  Information provided by this project will assist land managers in designing management activities that address natural and anthropogenic threats by protecting migratory birds, managing habitats, enforcing laws, evaluating permit applications, and planning for future environmental change.   This information may be particularly valuable to USFWS and other landowners for resource conservation (habitat protection, enhancement, and acquisition) and regulatory activities, especially two issues of recent concern - the siting and permitting of communication towers and wind power turbines known to cause bird mortality.This project does not focus on a particular priority species of conservation concern identified by USFWS or the Sonoran Joint Venture (JV) (both of whom are providing partial funding) or by PIF; rather, it will provide broad-scale information about landbird migration and habitat use patterns in the Southwest.  The results may also aid in guiding future, field-based research to identify the locations and relative importance of various habitat types used by passage migrants.  Depending on the results of this project, a future phase of the project may direct on-the-ground efforts to ground truth radar-determined patterns of habitat use and expand our knowledge of migration ecology at smaller spatial scales, either using collaborators already doing migration research in the area or directing additional efforts to conduct such research or monitoring.  In addition, depending on the results of this project, there will be opportunities to apply these and related approaches to other areas in the West that have already expressed interest in the project (e.g., USFWS Region 6 (Intermountain West) Migratory Bird Office, and organizations in the State of California).\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will use data from digital Doppler weather surveillance radar (known as NEXRAD for NEXt generation RADar) to study migration during spring 2005 and 2006 and fall 2005 in the Southwest (s. AZ, s. NM, w. TX, and s. CA).  Data from 14 radars will be retrieved and analyzed using existing capabilities at the University of Southern Mississippi.  The objectives above describe four different biological analyses of NEXRAD data as described below.  Regional analysis - Variation in migrant density during mid-nocturnal flight across the Southwest will be estimated seasonally.  For each radar, migrations dominated by birds and not contaminated by weather or other unwanted echoes will be identified.  Representative data during the peak of each of these nocturnal migrations will be retained for analysis.  This approach controls for range bias and avoids regions where ground clutter completely or partially obstructs the radars beam.  From these data, mean and standard deviation in migrant echo strength will be computed for the entire season for each radar.  Spatial, seasonal, and yearly variation in migrant density (i.e. migrant echo strength) will be explored.  Habitat-migrant associations - For each radar, where radar coverage is unobstructed by relief in terrain, we will attempt to associate radar echoes caused by migrating birds with their source stopover habitats.  Habitats or landscapes that hold more birds during stopover should be associated with stronger radar echoes when these birds initiate migration.  Birds leave their stopover habitat and fly up into the radar beam during the hours immediately following sunset.  Analyzing radar data approximately an hour after sunset is optimal for mapping this phenomenon.   Migrant flight altitude distribution - Weather radar-based information on target altitude is relatively coarse because NEXRAD is a broad brush instrument.  Nonetheless, by stacking information from multiple elevation sweeps of a radars beam, it is possible to construct vertical profiles of the migratory layer.  Because landbirds usually migrate within the lowest 2 km of the troposphere, the radars beam begins to pass over the migratory layer at relatively short ranges from the radar.   For this reason, only data close to the radar (but avoiding clutter near the radar) will be used in quantifying migrant flight altitude distributions.Migrant direction of travel - NEXRAD is a Doppler system, meaning it provides information on the speed and direction of movement (i.e. velocity) of targets in addition to the strength of target echoes.  Using data from NEXRAD radial velocity, we will estimate the direction of travel at the peak of each nocturnal migration.  Seasonally, each radar will be characterized by a mean and standard deviation in the distribution of directions of travel across migrations, perhaps weighted by the strength of the migration.  Ground clutter - The analyses considered above rely on a clear indication of where radar data are not influenced by beam obstruction; primarily in the case of this study this is caused by topography (mountains) obstructing the radar beam.  Therefore, early in the project we will map regions where the radars beam is not partially or completely obstructed by terrain for each of the 14 radars.  Initially, we will include regions of radar coverage showing &#8804;10% obstruction, consistent with existing obstruction maps.  However, there are some concerns about whether this approach adequately describes beam bostruction around some radars.  Therefore, in addition, a radar-specific empirical examination will be required to understand where data are unbiased by obstruction.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources 5:  Enhance USGS wildlife research to meet emerging and future issues.  Build additional capabilitites, expertise, and capacity in the WTER Program to meet the emerging needs of USGS partners as wildlife isseus take on new importance in today's society. We ask the following questions about avian behavior, ecology, and movement patterns across the Southwest.  These questions determine the objectives that follow.1. How does migrant density vary regionally across the    southwest?2.  What habitat preferences or associations do migrants exhibit during stopover in the southwest, and how may these patterns of habitat use be shaped by regional variations in migrant density?3.  To what extent does beam obstruction limit application of radar for bird studies in mountainous terrain?4.  How do migrant flight altitude distributions vary across the southwest?5.  How do migrant directions of travel vary across the southwest?6.  How do the above patterns vary seasonally, and in (1) and (2), annually?In this project we propose to use data from weather surveillance radar to:  Year 1:  Regional variation in migrant density  a.  Estimate geographic variation in migrant density during flight across the Southwest for Spring and Fall 2005.  b.  Assess whether radar offers evidence that migrants exhibit structure in their nocturnal distributions aloft consistent with migratory routes, a departure from long-held views that migration occurs across a broad-front.  c.  Map radar beam obstruction caused by ground clutter.  This will allow us to identify where habitat-migrant associations are possible for Year 2 work.Year 2:  Habitat-migrant associations  a.  Estimate habitat-migrant associations for Spring 2005 and Fall 2005 across the southwestern U.S. based on data availability determined by mapping beam obstruction (Year 1c).  b.  Repeat Year 1a for Spring 2006 to explore annual variation in regional migrant density patterns.  c.  Ensure that software tools are available to explore migrant flight altitude distribution variation in Year 3.Year 3:  Regional variation in migrant flight altitude distribution and velocity  a.  Estimate variation in migrant flight altitude across the southwestern U.S. for Spring and Fall 2005.  b.  Estimate regional variation in migrant direction of travel across the southwestern U.S. for Spring and Fall 2005.  c.  Repeat Year 2a for Spring 2006 to explore annual variation in habitat-migrant associations.An additional objective is to organize and implement a collaborative USGS-USFWS workshop on radar technology applications to natural resource issues.  This will involve strengthening existing USGS-USFWS collaborations and expanding the collaborative to include other federal, state, academic, and private conservation partners.  To be held in October 2006.  The P.I. is the chair of the workshop planning committee.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Users:  The data and interpretations resulting from this project will be valuable to all land managers and other organizations that are interested in knowing about bird migration patterns in the Southwest, the value of particular habitat types as migratory stopovers, and that need to protect migratory birds and protect and manage their migration stopover habitats.  This would include federal land management agencies (e.g., USFWS, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service), State wildlife agencies, and conservation organizations (e.g., National Audubon Society, The Nature Conservancy, the American Bird Conservancy).  It will provide information about patterns, timing, and variation in bird migration and will hopefully provide information about crucial stopover sites.  It will be particularly useful to the USFWS, as they also enforce laws protecting migratory birds and listed species and evaluate permit applications for actions, such as the siting of wind power turbines and communication towers that may negatively affect migrants.  In addition, the results of this project will inform future phases of this project as well as other research projects by providing information about migration in the Southwest and productively directing our efforts as we focus on field-based studies of bird migration to expand on this knowledge and address the needs of natural resource managers. Technology Transfer:  Annual progress evaluations and written reports will be provided throughout the life of the project (due the end of each fiscal year).  Preliminary results and maps, as available, will be provided to all funding sources, and a final report will be provided at project completion.  At the end of the first project year, products will include a map of radar beam obstruction due to ground clutter for the Southwest mapped in a GIS context onto land cover layers.  In addition, there will be preliminary reports for the objectives related to migrant density gradients and patterns.  Products from the subsequent years will be influenced to some extent by the results from the first year.  Final products, especially map-based products, will be made available on the internet through USGS.  Results from the project will be published in peer-reviewed journals and made available to the scientific and management communities through reports and presentations (e.g. briefings to USFWS and other funding agencies).   Where possible and appropriate, published articles and reports will also be made available on the USGS FORT website.In addition, a workshop on radar technology applications to natural resource issues will be held in October 2006 to bring together existing and new partners in a collaborative effort.  The P.I. is the chair of the workshop planning committee.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings The results from Year 1 show that there is substantial radar beam obstruction due to topography (e.g. mountains)in the western half of the Southwest region being studied.  This posed challenges as we proceeded with radar data analyses and will continue to pose challenges to using radar to look at bird migration in the west. Results published in the Studies in Avian Biology volume show that in the borderlands region, birds fly lower and faster in spring migration than in fall migration. Seasonal differences in migrant altitudes may be partially explained by seasonal differences in the altitudes of favorable winds.  Seasonal differences in migrant grounds speeds may be due to multiple reasons.  Direction of flight are generally north in spring and south in fall, although the patterns are consistent the existence of distinct regional migratory systems.Results in the final report and the manuscript published in The Condor found that in fall there was a greater passage of migrants through New Mexico and west Texas; in spring there was some suggestion of greater passage in central and south Texas.  Using radar data and satellite land cover data, we determined the habitats with which they are associated during migration stopover.  There were significant differences in bird densities among habitat types at all sites in at least one season.  Upland forest habitat in parts of Arizona and New Mexico supported high migrant densities, especially in fall.  Developed habitat in areas with little upland forest habitat also supported high migrant densities.  Scrub/shrub and grassland habitats supported low to intermediate migrant densities, but because these habitat types dominate the Southwestern landscape, they may support larger numbers of migratory birds than previously recognized.  Target identity remains a challenge for radar-based studies.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments In activities related to this task, the task leader has established a Cooperative Agreement between USGS and the University of Southern Mississippi (USM).  In Year 1, Dr. Robert Diehl, the collaborator at USM, and his graduate student, Rodney Felix, have addressed questions #1 and #3, and objectives \"a\" and \"c\" for Year 1 as described in the Objective section of the Task Narrative.  The Administrative Report for the first year has been completed, approved by USGS, and provided to funding agencies.  In Year 2, Dr. Diehl and Rodney Felix have addressed objectives for Year II \"b\" and \"c\" and have continued to revise and improve analyses and interpretations for the Year I objectives as additional information is developed. The Administrative Report for the second year has been drafted, approved and provided to funding agencies.  The Year III (final) project report was published as a USGS Open-File Report in December 2010 (see Products).  Copies were provided to funding agencies in January 2011.  In March 2011 a presentation was given at the joint AFO/COS/WOS meetings in Kearney, NE about the project results (see Products). Data from the OFR that have not yet been published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature were developed into a manuscript that was submitted to Ecological Applications in May 2011; it was returned without review in early June with recommendation for an ornithological journal.  The ms has been accepted for publication in The Condor, but as of 8 August 2012 PI is awaiting contact from the copy editor for final publication copy editing changes and proofs.   A paper on preliminary results from the study was presented at the North American Ornithological Conference in October 2006 in Veracruz, Mexico.  A manuscript from this presentation has been published in a volume of Studies In Avian Biology (No. 37) on US-Mexico borderlands bird isues. A second manuscript was published in The Condor in 2012. Joint presentations about the results of this project and publications were given in November 2013 at University of New Mexico, and USFWS Region 2, Migratory Bird Office.In addition to project-specific activities, the USGS P.I. has been instrumental in forming a coalition of USGS scientists and USFWS collaborators using radar to study bird and bat migration.  The group, with her leadership, hosted an interagency workshop in October 2006 in Albuquerque, NM, funded by USGS to bring together existing and potential collaborators.  The proceedings from this workshop are available as a USGS Open-File Report. In addition, two of the key action items from the workshop have been met - (1) the development of a website with info about applications of radar technology to biological issues, and (2) a Fact Sheet explaining to managers how to use long-range radar in addressing resource management issues.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED:Using stable isotopes and trace elements to link seasonal habitats of neotropical migratory shorebirds\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Identifying linkages between the seasonal habitats of migratory birds is critical to conservation efforts because such knowledge is needed to effectively focus management efforts.  The need to identify habitat linkages is especially acute for Neotropical migrants because of the land use changes and associated habitat destruction that are rapidly occurring in portions of Latin America where these species spend the winter.  We cannot insure the conservation of these species through action only in North America; effective conservation of these long-distance migrants will require International cooperation.  For most Neotropical migrants, however, virtually nothing is known about which habitats are limiting because the links between their seasonal habitats on different continents have not been clearly identified.  Traditional techniques have not been very effective in identifying habitat linkages and migratory pathways of many long-distance migrants.  Banding, or ringing, provides little information because there are so few returns for non-game birds.  Radio/satellite telemetry has limited application to many non-game species that are too small to carry powerful transmitters.   DNA analyses provide no direct information on the location of habitats used by birds.Feathers are unique among a birds body tissues because they grow in a very short time and, thereafter, become metabolically inert.  Consequently, the chemical content of a feather reflects the birds diet during the short period of time when the feather was grown.  Shorebirds that breed in the Arctic and winter in the southern hemisphere molt their flight feathers once per year, on the winter grounds just prior to spring migration.  Thus, the flight feathers carry chemical markers that are characteristic of a birds previous winter area.  Learning to interpret these distinct chemical markers in shorebird feathers would give us the ability to associate individual birds, captured anywhere else (e.g., on the breeding grounds, in migration), with specific winter sites, thereby helping to identify distinct areas used by different subpopulations.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The study will focus on three species: the Pectoral Sandpiper (Calidris melanotos), the Bairds Sandpiper (Calidris bairdii), and the White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis).  These species make annual migrations that span large expanses of the Western hemisphere.  The wintering area used by these species also overlaps the habitat used by more than 30 other shorebird species; thus the identification of diagnostic chemical markers for these species will be directly applicable to a larger number of other species of international importance.To identify the combination of isotopes and trace elements that provide the most diagnostic patterns, we will utilize a multivariate approach, analyzing a suite of isotopes and trace elements.   Such an approach will substantially enhance our ability to identify a shorebirds specific winter region because chemical signatures in the environment originate through different processes.  First, deuterium (dD) and oxygen rations (d18O) vary with latitude as a function of atmospheric processes.  We analyzed data from the Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) for 18 Argentine sites and found that dD (as well as d18O) is significantly related to latitude (R=0.861; p<0.001).  Hence, these isotopes show broad scale patterns that will be useful to establish the approximate latitude of a shorebirds winter habitat.  Second, stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur vary spatially according to other factors that are independent of the atmospheric processes that force patterns in deuterium and oxygen.  For example, estuarine/marine habitats can differ significantly in terms of sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen from inland habitats. Third, trace elements and radiogenic (such as Pb207/Pb206 and Sr87/Sr86) isotope signatures are more closely related to geological processes and hence will provide additional information on the geographic origin of individual birds.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources 5:  Enhance USGS wildlife research to meet emerging and future issues.  Build additional capabilitites, expertise, and capacity in the WTER Program to meet the emerging needs of USGS partners as wildlife isseus take on new importance in today's society. Status and Trends of Biological Resources-Provide a framework that facilitates the integration of information from a variety of sources at multiple spatial and temporal scales to describe and track the abundance, distribution, productivity, and health of the Nations plants, animals, and ecosystems. The key aspect of this study will be learning to interpret the chemical markers, which will require that we: 1.  Identify and map the spatial variation in isotopic and trace element signatures across the winter range.  Flight feathers will be collected on the winter habitat, just before spring migration, along four latitudinal bands (between northern and southern Argentina).  Samples of precipitation, plants, and invertebrates will also be collected at each site.  The samples will be analyzed for a suite of isotopes including hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur as well as trace elements, 207Pb/206Pb and 87Sr/86Sr.  The data will be analyzed to construct relationships that will allow prediction of a birds winter location at a course spatial scale (Provincial level of resolution). Given the predictive relationships developed in 1 above, we will test two hypotheses related to identifying large-scale population subdivision and habitat usage:    2. Assess the degree of population subdivision on the breeding grounds.   Flight feathers will be collected from nesting females across their Arctic breeding grounds between 900E and 900 W longitude.  We will test the null hypothesis that a birds breeding location cannot be predicted from knowledge of its winter latitude (i.e., birds are mixed on the breeding grounds) versus the alternative that populations are subdivided and use different breeding/winter areas. 3. Assess the degree of mixing on specific migration stopovers.  We will collect feather samples, both early and late during spring and fall migration, across an east-west gradient in the migration corridor (roughly from the Atlantic coast west to eastern Colorado).  We will test the null hypotheses that a) a birds migration path is not related to its winter latitude, and b) a birds timing of migration is not related to its winter latitude; versus the alternatives that birds from different winter areas migrate with different timing and/or through different migration corridors.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Study results will be communicated to the scientific community and the general public through presentations at scientific meetings, workshops, peer-reviewed papers and press releases.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Through the field season of 2006 we have collected and analyzed isotopes from shorebird flight fdeathers collected at 48 sites in 13 different provinces from northern Argentina to Tierra del Fuego. The student at the University Nacional de Cordoba, Julian Torres, has finished writing his thesis, and defended on 27 May 2005.  With the help of Adrian Farmer, Julian submitted a successful application for a Fullbright Fellowship, which will fund his Ph.D. program at Colorado State University, begininning in August 2005.  This Ph. D. progrtam will be directed at a topic concerning the use of stable isotopes to tarck migratory birds, and will be a logical followup to his M.S. research. Julian has shown that we can identify the site use by a shorebird with an accuracy of about 250 kms.   The second student at the Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia, Monica Abril, completed her third full field season in January 2006.  About ten additional sites were added to the stable isotope database in portions of western Argentina that had not been sampled earlier. She came to the FORT during the summer of 2006 for two weeks to process her 2006 samples, and is currently analyzing her data.   We analyzed the data from Alaska and Russian breeding Pectoral Sandpipers in the spring of 2006 and see a large difference in isotopic signatures between these two breeding populations.  This very exciting result shows that these birds winter in distinctly different areas of South America and this is the very first evidence of its kind for Neotropical shorebirds. The focus in 2007 will be on trying to enhance our database of samples from Alaska and Russia (by working with collaborators) to further investiigate the differences between these populations, publishing study results including an Argentina-wide synthesis of results and an analysis of the sources of error as well as the efficacy of the technique for identifying a bird's geographic origin.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED - Status and distribution of mammals on public lands\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In spite of over 125 years of mammal surveys in the western United States, large tracts of public land have never been systematically surveyed.  These unstudied areas include many Fish and Wildlife National Wildlife Refuges, National Parks and Monuments, and Bureau of Land Management National Monuments and Resource Areas.  As a result of this lack of knowledge there is an imperfect understanding of what mammal species occur on public lands, a deficiency in how to manage those species; and status, population levels, and other ecosystem information is lacking.For example, historically, several places on the Colorado Plateau have been the subjects of geological and biological explorations. Until very recently, access to many areas on the plateau has been difficult and as a consequence, these areas have remained relatively poorly-known.  Again, this relative lack of knowledge about fauna and flora of the plateau applies to most Federal lands, including Fish and Wildlife Service refuges, Bureau of Land Management areas, and National Park Service (NPS) lands.  However, several federal agencies are interested in rectifying this situation, in particular by funding baseline inventories, monitoring efforts, and status surveys for mammals.  For example, in 2000, the NPS initiated a nationwide program to obtain better information on occurrence of vertebrates and plants on NPS lands.  In 2001, the Fort Collins Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey, joined this effort as a cooperator in a five-year effort to conduct surveys for terrestrial and volant mammals occurring on national parks or monuments in the NPS Northern and Southern Colorado Plateau Networks.  In 2001-2002 we worked on 9 parks in the north and 5 in the south.  In 2003, scientists from FORT began work on 3 additional parks in the SCPN: El Malpais, Chaco Culture, and Bandelier national monuments.  In 2004, we initiated surveys for bats in Canyonlands NP.  We also joined cooperators from the University of New Mexico (UNM) in conducting mammalian inventories on selected national parks in Alaska.  This work is a continuation of work previously conducted by Dr. Joe Cook and associates of UNM.Region 6 of Fish and Wildife Service has also been a leader in funding work to acquire information on status and distribution of mammals on refuge lands.  In 2001, the Center initiated surveys at two National Wildlife Refuges in Nebraska: Crescent Lake and North Platte.  Although some mammal work has been conducted at Crescent Lake, we are aware of no previous mammal work at North Platte. The Center also cooperates with other federal agencies in conducting field studies and surveys of mammals of mutual interest.  For example, we are conducting low-level surveys for mammals in the Henry Mountains Resource Area of the Bureau of Land Managaement in Utah.  Additionally, staff of this project interact with and cooperate with management and research personnel of state agencies, including state wildlife agencies and universities.  As needed and approved by the Project Chief, staff provide information and render assistance in conducting biological surveys.  At present, low levels of assistance are being provided to the state of New Mexico (NM Dept. of Game and Fish) and Texas (Texas Tech Univ. and TX Dept Parks and Wildlife).  In some cases this assistance is a portion of mutually-agreed-to cooperation in which personnel from other universities and agencies assist USGS personnel in our field activities.  Interaction and communication among personnel from the various agencies enhances available information on mammals.  Activities in New Mexico include low-level surveys of bats whereas we are assisting with mammal surveys in the mountains of Trans-Pecos Texas, especially in the Chinati Mountains.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Small mammals  For inventory efforts where densities of small mammals are not required, live traps can be effectively set in lines in appropriate habitat with starting points determined randomly.  We will use approximately 20 paired trap lines, and each line will have 20 trap stations with two traps each.  Traps will be set for three nights, baited with rolled oats in most cases, checked at least twice per day, and will be closed during daylight hours except for directed efforts on diurnal species when traps will be checked frequently to prevent mortality.  Where possible, live traps will be set at habitat features (e.g., logs, trees, burrows) within 2m of the station point.  Where linear Calhoun lines cannot be deployed, single lines will be set with 20 stations and two traps per station.  Effort and catch will be quantified based on numbers of nights a given number of traps are set (trap-nights).  Bats - Bats will be sampled in several ways, depending on availability of known or suspected roosts, and presence of water sources.  Where roosting sites are known or suspected the sites will be observed without disturbing the bats as the great likelihood is that such aggregations will be maternity colonies (females with young).  Such roosts can be selectively and carefully netted from the outside to determine species identification.  We may also choose to videotape exit flights of bats as appropriate.  We believe that detection of roost sites using radiotransmitters affixed to bats is a research question that generally is not appropriate for inventory purposes.  For bats roosting in small numbers, they can be hand-captured, identified, and released but such attempts should be used cautiously in maternity colonies.   Where bats are not readily captured, we will develop walking transects to search for bat presence based on observations of guano and insect remains.In selected areas it may be necessary to use a bat detector to determine the presence of bats. Sample points or transects can be randomly selected and both species diversity and relative activity levels can be determined at a pre-determined number of points along the line.  Most North American investigators use the Australian bat detector Anabat, made by Titley.  Also, some species of bats have audible echolocation cries and experienced personnel can recognize those calls to help document presence of some species.  Typically, calls are recorded on the hard drives of laptop recorders and saved for subsequent analysis.  Calls also can be saved on high-quality tape recorders or compact disk devices for analysis.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Status and Trends 4 - Produce and provide analyses and reports that synthesize information on the status and trends of our Nation's flora, fauna, and ecosystems and are responsive to the needs of the scientific community, land and resource managers, policy makers, and the public.  a.  To document through existing, verifiable data (which may include voucher specimens) and targeted field investigations, the occurrence of at least 90 percent of the species of vertebrates and vascular plants estimated to occur on the parks and refuges. b.  To describe the distribution and relative abundance of species of special concern, such as threatened and endangered species, exotics, and other species of special management interest occurring within public land boundaries.c.  To provide the baseline information needed to develop a general monitoring strategy and design that can be implemented by the land manager once inventories have been completed.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Data will be stored at the Aridlands Field Station of the FORT and the information will be available through websites, or will be provided in other ways (e.g. CDs) if necessary or desirable.  Standard data formats and standards will be followed.  The final reports, all data tables, and coordinates for geo-referenced study sites also will be provided in electronic form.  The reports will include multiple appendices detailing the occurrence, locality, and relative abundance of species studied.  USGS will make recommendations on abundance, distribution, and occurrence of mammals on the parks as a function of apparent management, and will provide specific suggestions on long-term monitoring of mammals where appropriate.  This project will be entered into the USGS BASIS+ where others can become aware of the work.  Metadata on the project will be served as specified by USGS/NBII data standards.  As appropriate, data will be used in scientific manuscripts for the peer-reviewed literature and in talks presented to professional societies.  Verbal presentations also may be provided to individual offices of NPS.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings In 2001 we initiated inventories of mammals on selected national parks and monuments within the Northern Colorado Plateau Network (NCPN) of the National Park Service.  The overarching goal of these efforts was to begin efforts to document 90% of mammals that are suspected of occurring on national parklands.  We worked on nine different parks: Capitol Reef and Black Canyon National Parks, Curecanti National Recreation Area, Golden Spike National Historic Site, and Cedar Breaks, Fossil Butte, Hovenweep, Pipe Springs, and Timpanogos Cave National Monuments.  In 2001 we also initiated inventories of mammals on selected national monuments within the Southern Colorado Plateau Network (SCPN) as part of the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring project.  The overarching goal of these inventory efforts was to document 90% of the mammal species potentially occurring on each park.  We worked on four different monuments, Aztec Ruins (AZRU), Petroglyph (PETR), Salinas Pueblo Missions (SAPU), and Yucca House (YUHO).  In January 2003 and February 2004 we submitted Final Reports to the NPS on work on these first 14 parks.  In the summer of 2003 we initiated new inventories at three additional parks in the Southern Colorado Plateau: Chaco Canyon, El Malpais, and Bandelier National Monuments.In early 2004 we submitted an annual report to the Southern Colorado Plateau Network.  Field work continued on these three parks in 2004 and a Draft Final Report on this work was submitted to NPS in January 2005.  We are awaiting comments from NPS at this time.  In summer 2004, we initiated an inventory for bats at Canyonlands National Park for the Northern Colorado Plateau Network.  This is a two-year study.  In 2004 we captured and released 1053 bats of 14 species and identified the audible cries of a 15th species.  A preliminary report was provided to NPS in September 2004.  This work will continue in the summer of 2005.  Other assistance has been provided to NPS in connection with these surveys.In January 2005 we submitted an annual report on our 2004 bat inventory activities.  Work at Canyonlands in 2005 started in April 2005 and continued through October.  A preliminary report on 2005 activities was submitted in September.  A draft final report and subsequent final report on work at CANY was submitted in early 2006 and this study is completed.In 2004 and 2005 we also provided assistance to cooperators at Texas Tech University and TX Parks and Wildlife Dept in connection with biological surveys for mammmals in Chinati Mts., Trans-Pecos Texas.  An annual report was submitted by TTU.  In 2003, we initiated a small mammal inventory in Colorado at Great Sand Dunes and Florissant Fossil Beds National Monuments.  This Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) project was conducted as an interagency agreement with National Park Service.  An annual report was submitted in 2004 to the National Park Service.  A draft final report was submitted in 2005 and a final report was submitted to the National Park Service in 2006.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Many professional activities that are important in the scientific research process do not fall neatly within specific research tasks.  These activities are covered here under the general task of research program development and technical assistance, and include service to national and international scientific societies (including providing scientific peer reviews), and providing technical assistance based on scientific expertise developed over the careers of the scientists.  As research tasks conclude, there is a need to spend time exploring possibilities for future research - identifying priority needs, opportunities, and funding possibilities.  Ongoing communications between USGS and the various land management, private, and research agencies with which we work will ensure that priority research needs regarding conservation biology of terrestrial vertebrates and avian species in arid lands are met in the most effective and efficient manner, and that the resulting information is disseminated to those who will use it.  In addition staff routinely respond to technical assistance questions from staff of client agencies.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Development of new research projects will be accomplished by communicating with all necessary/possible client bureau contacts and funding sources, and by conducting background research (e.g., literature searches)to develop proposed methods and research focuses.  Improved communications will be achieved through attendance at or organization of meetings that facilitate the exchange of information about research needs and results, and discussion of future needs, planning, and funding.  This might involve attendance at existing scientific or management meetings, or separate meetings specifically organized for this purpose.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Improving geochemical methods for assessing the impacts of anthropogenic landscape changes on wildlife\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Hundreds of animal species make long-distance migrations, but details about the magnitude and specifics of such movements are often unknown. Issues related to geographic origins and migration of animals have attracted great attention in recent years because of an increasing need to understand the distributions and habitat requirements of species. Conventional tools for following animal movements over long-distances, such as transmitters, are not feasible on smaller animals because of technological limitations. Geochemical techniques offer an alternative approach for studying migration. This approach is based on the premise that animals sample their environs by incorporating geochemical signals into their tissues via diet and that such signals reflect consistent differences in landscape geochemistry. Increasing interest in the potential for geochemical methods to track the origins of plants and animals is emanating from disciplines as varied as public health (e.g., movement of avian influenza), economics (movement of harmful agricultural pests or invasive species), law enforcement (poaching, origins of plant-derived narcotics), and conservation (origins of migrants killed by wind turbines or other hazards caused by anthropogenic changes in land use).  Stable isotope applications have gained widespread attention as a means of tracking migration and scores of animal movement studies using stable isotopes were published in the past decade. However, two underlying assumptions of such studies are that specific geographic areas have distinct stable isotope signatures (i.e., isoscapes) and that variation within the isoscape is limited through time and among individuals within the population occurring there. These assumptions have never been adequately tested. Validating such assumptions through detailed study of a population that is highly constrained in time and space would represent a novel contribution to our current understanding of isotope distributions in natural ecosystems, as well as the propagation of isoscape fingerprints into local and migratory populations of animals.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology 1) We will quantify isotopic variation within a population of non-migratory, spatially constrained animals by analyzing isotopic signatures (H,O,C,N,S) in fur from a large number of marked big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) living in buildings around the city of Fort Collins, Colorado.  We will trap bats at roosts during the spring and summer of 2008 and collect fur samples from approximately 500 individuals.  Samples gathered in 2008 will be analyzed and compared to reference samples collected in previous years (see progress).  Analysis will focus on characterizing isotopic variation among years, individuals, and demographic groups.2)  We will investigate the geographic origins of bats killed at wind turbines by analyzing fur samples from hoary bats killed at wind turbines, sent to us by collaborators in New York (~250 bats/yr).  Analysis will focus on characterizing variation in isotope signatures of demographic groups and estimating of geographic origins of the fatalities. Dr. Cryan will be responsible for field sampling in Fort Collins and obtaining samples from New York. Sample preparation duties will be split between the FORT and GD labs. Drs. Stricker and Rye will be responsible for analysis of samples at the GD lab in Denver. Lab analyses will characterize the isotope ratios of H, O, C, N, and S in the fur of all bats. All investigators will help analyze and interpret resulting data, present findings at scientific meetings, and publish results in scientific journals.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife Resources - Develop scientific information and decision support tools that DOI needs to effectively manage wildlife resources, understand the movement of wildlife diseases, and assess the impacts of climate change on wildlife populations.1) Quantify isotopic variation within a population of non-migratory, spatially constrained animals2) Use stable isotope techniques to investigate the geographic origins of bats killed at wind turbines (see project 8327CNG, Task 17 for Background)\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Interim progress reports will be delivered upon request. Results will be communicated at scientific meetings and manuscripts submitted for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. All digital and hardcopy data will be housed at the USGS Fort Collins Science Center and at the GD Lab in Denver. Metadata will be served on the NBII Metadata Clearinghouse.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings This work provided important new information on the amount of variation in isotopic \"signatures\" of individual bats living under very similar conditions, which helped inform migration research that relies on stable isotope methods.  A surprising finding of this work was that there was evidence of fine-scale structure in the isotopic signatures of big brown bats living in the city where the study occurred, suggesting that individual bats and groups of bats in this sedentary population are specializing on particular food resources or feeding grounds within the city.  This was a novel finding for opportunistic insectivorous bats. Building upon the first components of the study, we refined the use of stable isotopes to study migration movements of hoary bats, the species currently composing about 40-50% of all bat fatalities at wind turbines in the U.S. and Canada.  The isotopic methods we developed allowed us to gain unprecedented insight into the continental movements of individual hoary bats and relate that information in important ways to both their susceptibility to wind turbines and white-nose syndrome.  Methods and knowledge resulting from this project are helping to guide new studies into this poorly understood group of mammals.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Effects of climate change on white-tailed ptarmigan using genetics, stable isotopes and traditional population demographics methodologiesSEE TASK 26 in RBOOCNJ for Annual Updates and Products!!!\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The most urgent question confronting scientists during the coming century asks How will organisms respond to a dramatically changing climate? Here, we will use white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus) as a model system to understand responses to climate change by a species with limited opportunity for latitudinal or altitudinal dispersal.  We will address the following questions.  How has climate influenced the demographics, genetics, and nutritional ecology of ptarmigan?  What are the implications of such influences on the species ability to adapt to future changes in climate?  Does a changing climate increase the vulnerability of ptarmigan to local extinction?  Are there management interventions that could reduce these vulnerabilities?  What generalities can be extended to other vertebrate species from a case study of ptarmigan?\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Investigation of the interaction between ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change is an important aspect of climate change.  A better understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypes under selection may allow prediction and mitigation of the effects of climate change on population viability (Reusch and Wood 2007).  We propose to document changes in genetic diversity and allele frequencies in white-tailed ptarmigan from Mt. Evans over a 41-year time span. Further, we will attempt to identify genetic markers under selection and determine whether these markers can be correlated with environmental changes associated with climate change and population-level demographic changes.         In natural populations, genetic variation decreases through random loss of alleles and/or through inbreeding (Frankham 1995). The inability to adapt to rapid environmental change, despite directional selection, may be due to a lack of polymorphism of genes underlying traits (Reusch and Wood 2007).  Thus, documenting changes in genetic diversity through time will provide a better understanding of the capacity of white-tailed ptarmigan to adapt to climate change. This comparison will be made using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers shown to work well in ptarmigan (Piertney and Dallas 1997, Segelbecher et. al. 2000, Caizergues et al. 2001, Taylor et al. 2003).      Identifying the genetic basis of traits relevant to fitness under climate change is becoming more feasible as molecular tools advance.  Such information will aid in predicting the effects of climate change as the presence and diversity of critical genes can be directly assessed (Reusch and Wood 2007).  Thus, to address climate change, focus must shift from neutral markers to characterizing selectively important markers for monitoring (Vasemagi and Primmer 2005). This will be accomplished using a population genomics approach with through the analysis of microsatellite and amplified fragment length polymorphisms. Markers thought to be under selection will be investigated retrospectively for the Mt. Evans population, thereby providing direct evidence that evolution has occurred and allowing for identification of potential environmental variables that may be causal.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Our work will address research theme one of the USGS Global Change FY08 RFP, providing resource managers with information needed to prepare for expected changes in climate.  Many managers are responsible for species that may become threatened or endangered as a result climate change influences on population viability.  Because such changes will require management intervention, decision makers need information to anticipate effects of climate on sensitive species and to identify potential ways of mitigating those effects.  The white-tailed ptarmigan is an avian species that inhabits alpine habitat.  Their distribution includes mountain tops from southeastern Alaska and Yukon Territory southward through the Rocky Mountains (Braun et al. 1993).  Thus, the white-tailed ptarmigan offer a useful model of a species that will have limited options to change their distribution in response to climate warming.  As such, ptarmigan are particularly sensitive to climate effects because they will not be able to adapt by migrating to novel environments.  Similarly, the sub-arctic and alpine ecosystems they inhabit are among the most sensitive to future climate change.  Understanding the implications of climate change in these systems will be of importance to many USGS clients and DOI partners charged with managing alpine habitats.  Our work also will provide information specific to managing an important species in these habitats and will generally inform the question of how to manage species affected by climate change due to their limited dispersal capabilities.USGS has identified research on global climate change as an area of extreme importance.  As mentioned earlier, our proposed work directly addresses theme one of the USGS Global Change FY08 RFP, to Provide information needed to increase the preparedness of resource managers and communities for expected changes in climate, sea level, land and freshwater resources,. Our proposal also addresses the first two science directions of the USGS Science Strategy (Circular 1309), Understanding Ecosystems and Predicting Ecosystem Change and Climate Variability and Change, and US Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) Goal 4 to Understand the sensitivity and adaptability of different natural and managed ecosystems and human systems to climate and related global changes.  Further, this proposal includes scientists from both biology and geology, specifically addresses needs identified by the USGS Science Strategy, and supports DOI management needs.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan The primary physical products will include 1) peer-reviewed journal articles, 2) a web site summarizing findings and management recommendations, and 3) a web accessible archive of past and future data.  We will communicate findings scientific peers to assure the credibility of products.  In addition, our work will be used as the basis for sound decisions by managers as we will communicate our results succinctly and clearly using the web and non-technical publications. We will organize or attend existing meetings with other climate change scientists, managers and/or the public, as requested and beneficial in support of our products.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings While we found no changes in genetic allele frequencies across time periods, we noted a trend of loss of heterozygosity through time.  Allelic richness values also were lower in more recent times yet not significantly using an alpha of 0.05 (P < 0.1). This suggests that while population sizes may not have changed dramatically, some loss of genetic variation was noted, which may be important for the long-term viability of the species. Feather &#61540;13C and &#61540;15N values decreased significantly across time periods, whereas the range in isotope values increased consistently from the late 1930s to the later time periods.  Inferred changes in the nutritional ecology of White-tailed Ptarmigan on Mt. Evans relates primarily to increased atmospheric deposition of nutrients that likely influenced tundra plant composition and nutritional quality.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED - FWS: Pacific sheath-tailed bat assessments on Aguiguan and Tinian, Commonwealth of Northern Marianas\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Assessment of the sheath-tailed bats on Aguiguan and Tinian, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands focused on seven objectives:  1)  Conduct surveys for previously known and new roosts of sheath-tailed bats on Aguiguan; 2) Make visual count-based estimates of colony sizes based on observations of bats exiting roosts at night, including comparison with results of prior surveys, and replicate counts at selected colonies supplemented by enhanced low light video; 3) Determine food of sheath-tailed bats on Aguiguan based on analyses of insect parts in the feces of bats sampled in hand and at roosts in relation to reference samples of nocturnal insects; 4)  Establish a baseline site-occupancy model of spatial occurrence on Aguiguan using bat echolocation detectors in forested habitats following methods employed for the endangered Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus semotus), including measures of temporal feeding activity; 5) Increase baseline natural history information such as size, body mass, ectoparasitism, possible reproduction, non-destructive sampling of tissues for future conservation genetics studies, and salvage of specimens found dead in caves for accession into accredited research museum collections; 6) Search selected karst areas and caves on Tinian for evidence of sheath-tailed bats.  Our assessment of the current status and natural history of the sheathtailed bat will take place on Aguiguan over a 28-day field period from mid-June to mid-July, with an additional 4-day survey of caves in selected areas of Tinian.  The purpose of the assessment will be to determine its current status and use of caves, establish a baseline survey of patterns of activity and use of foraging habitat with echolocation detectors and site-occupancy models, establish baseline information on insects in its diet, and collect additional data and biological samples to increase understanding of its natural history.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology OBJECTIVE 1: PIs will review literature and will be assisted by G. J. Wiles in locating historic and new roost sites. Caves will be temporarily marked, photographed, geographically referenced by GPS. We will measure habitat characteristics such as size of cave, temperature, humidity and other characteristics of caves bats use as roosts to attempt to understand factors of importance in their selection by sheath-tailed bats.  OBJECTIVE 2: Entrances of roosts will be monitored at dusk for emergence of bats. Individuals exiting the roost will be counted visually in fading light against the sky or lightest background. We will select the largest colonies with suitable access for replicated simultaneous counts using two or more observers and a low light video camera supplemented by infrared lights. Video recordings of bats emerging from caves will be observed at a later time by at least two people and an average of counts will be made.  OBJECTIVE 3: Fecal samples will be collected from bats that are captured during other assessment efforts. Fecal samples also will be collected from beneath roosts by placing ground cloths beneath roosting areas after bats exit to forage. Preliminary diet analyses will be conducted in the field. Full analyses of diet will be conducted at the Albuquerque field station. Fragments of insects found in fecal pellets will be compared to insect reference samples and identified to the lowest taxonomic level. Comparisons will also be made with fecal fragments from the co-occuring endangered Mariana swiftlet. OBJECTIVE 4: Bat biologists from the USGS Pacific Island Ecological Research Center will develop a baseline foraging site occupancy model using bat detectors. The focus will be to sample bat echolocation activity to provide a baseline for future comparative studies of the species status. Quantitative measures of bat activity to be generated with occupancy analysis include proportion of area occupied and detection probability. Additional metrics include basic statistics on call files. Occupancy analysis may use landcover class and proximity to known roosts as covariates in assessing bat activity. Activity will also be evaluated with a generalized linear model to assess significance of landcover class and roost proximity. Activity by time of night will be examined to determine temporal patterns.  OBJECTIVE 5: Composition of colonies will be verified by capturing bats in mist nets as they emerge from caves. We will also attempt to capture bats in nets at night. We will examine captured bats and record on standard data sheets the age class, sex, reproductive status, and body mass. Wing-punch biopsy samples will be taken as tissue specimen vouchers for potential future studies of genetics. Ectoparasites will be collected and identified. Bats will be released unharmed at the place of capture after examination. When possible fecal samples will be collected from cave floors for future contaminant analyses. We will also compile a list of specimens in museums and provide a written review of the species natural history.OBJECTIVE 6: General assessments of select karst areas will be conducted on Tinian to determine if there has been a recurrence or overlooked colonies of sheath-tailed bats on this island. Anabat detectors will be used to determine presence of bats flying at night.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Assessment of the sheath-tailed bats on Aguiguan and Tinian, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands focused on seven objectives:  1)  Conduct surveys for previously known and new roosts of sheath-tailed bats on Aguiguan; 2) Make visual count-based estimates of colony sizes based on observations of bats exiting roosts at night, including comparison with results of prior surveys, and replicate counts at selected colonies supplemented by enhanced low light video; 3) Determine food of sheath-tailed bats on Aguiguan based on analyses of insect parts in the feces of bats sampled in hand and at roosts in relation to reference samples of nocturnal insects; 4)  Establish a baseline site-occupancy model of spatial occurrence on Aguiguan using bat echolocation detectors in forested habitats following methods employed for the endangered Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus semotus), including measures of temporal feeding activity; 5) Increase baseline natural history information such as size, body mass, ectoparasitism, possible reproduction, non-destructive sampling of tissues for future conservation genetics studies, and salvage of specimens found dead in caves for accession into accredited research museum collections; 6) Search selected karst areas and caves on Tinian for evidence of sheath-tailed bats.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Primary products will include a final report of findings that include specific locations (GPS coordinates) of roosts, number of individuals counted and variability in counts, food types consumed, site occupancy and detectability determined using Anabat II detectors, and related natural history information.  Electronic copies of pertinent raw data collected during period of study will be provided.  Findings will also be published separately in appropriate journals.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings USGS and affiliated researchers were successful in locating historic roosts of the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Emballonura semicaudata) on Aguiguan in June and July 2008, with counts of individuals similar to the counts in 2003.  A total of 12 individuals were netted with new information obtained regarding the reproductive status of females during the end of summer and beginning of the rainy season on Aguiguan.  Analyses of fecal pellets show beetles, wasps, and moths are important components to the food habits of the Pacific sheath-tailed bat.  No ectoparasites were found, perhaps related to roosting habits of individuals.  No bats were observed in the forests of Tinian while using bat detectors in walking transects.  Data from echolocation monitoring stations on Aguiguan show that this bat is a specialist requiring native limestone forest for foraging habitat. Tissue and guano samples were obtained for future genetic analyses and contaminant residues, should funding become available.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments We found a small population of Pacific sheath-tailed bats on Aguiguan, and counted 359466 bats at 5 of 41 caves in 2008. Comparison with past counts suggests the population increased over the last 13 years. Occupied caves were larger than most unoccupied caves but had similar temperature and humidity. A few colonies of these bats may remain undiscovered in currently inaccessible caves on Aguiguan. We established a baseline site-occupancy model of spatial occurrence of foraging sheath-tailed bats on Aguiguan. We used ultrasonic calls to assess presence/absence of foraging bats at night in relation to habitat attributes. Thirty-one sampling stations were deployed, with 35,858 calls recorded. Peak activity and occurrence is related to canopy cover, vegetation stature, and distance to known roosts. Native limestone forest is the preferred foraging habitat. Echolocation calls of this species were characterized for the first time. We collected and analyzed 200 fecal pellets of bats from 2 roosts. The diet was diverse, but mostly consisted of small insects from 1.7 to 6.4 mm in length. Hymenopterans, lepidopterans, and coleopterans were the 3 major food groups. Silken fungus beetles and leaf beetles appear to be forest-dependent species and were a consistent component of the bats diet.  Prey items indicate that these bats foraged mainly in forest habitat during June-July. We collected other samples and obtained information on the natural history of Pacific sheath-tailed bats on Aguiguan. These bats easily avoided mist netsnand were sensitive to handling. We captured 12 adults and 1 suckling young. We determined body mass, forearm length, and reproductive condition of the 12 adults. We found considerable overlap in body size between E. semicaudata rotensis and the other 3 subspecies of Pacific sheath-tailed bats. Wing biopsies were collected from 12 bats to help ascertain genetic diversity of the population, and the depth of genetic division of this subspecies when compared to published data on E. s. semicaudata from other islands. We prepared 2 voucher specimens of E. s.rotensis, increasing the number of known specimens from the Mariana Islands in US museums from 2 to 4. We compiled information on specimens of Pacific sheath-tailed bats available for taxonomic study. Over 380 specimens including other subspecies exist worldwide, including over 20 from the Marianas Islands (including Guam) Expanded study of museum specimens and comparative genetic analyses are needed to better ascertain the systematic status of the population. Six females captured late in the rainy season of 2003 (September) were apparently not reproductive. In contrast, 7 of 8 females we captured in June-July 2008 were pregnant or lactating. We also observed 11 pups at roosts in caves in June and July; all were singletons. None of the bats we captured were volant young of the year. The presence of reproductive females and pups or embryos in June and July, but no volant young, suggests a diffuse seasonality in reproduction coinciding with the late June to early November rainy season. We observed 1 large embryo in a female, as was also observed in 1 female dissected in June 1984. These dissections and the observations of 11 apparent singleton pups suggest a litter size of 1. If reproduction occurs only once per year and litter size is 1, then the capacity for population growth in Pacific sheath-tailed bats will be very limited. Sheath-tailed bats are only known from Tinian based on prehistoric deposits in caves. During the last 4 days and nights of this study we searched for sheath-tailed bats on Tinian with echolocation detectors. We also queried knowledgeable individuals, and watched for bats and listened for audible calls. No bats were detected. However, more effort will be needed to rule out the possibility that a small remnant population of these bats may still exist on Tinian.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED- FWS: Mariana Fruit bat assessments on 9 islands in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The Mariana fruit bat (Pteropus mariannus mariannus) is a relatively large bat that is found in the 15 island archipelago of the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas (CNMI) and Guam. Because of direct impacts from over-harvesting for consumption, habitat loss, and the introduction of invasive species (e.g., brown tree snake, feral ungulates) that have had direct or indirect effects on bats, populations of the Mariana fruit bat have declined drastically leading to its Threatened status listed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.  Despite its Threatened status, populations of the Mariana fruit bat on some southern islands of the CNMI and Guam continue to decline, with much of the decline related to illegal hunting.  At present, most of the populations of the Mariana fruit bat are supported by the northern islands.  However, given the remote locations of these islands, many have not been surveyed as frequently as the southern islands or have been limited to only a single or few islands at a time.  In 1983, an archipelago-wide assessment of the Mariana fruit bat found that total population estimates were about 7,450 bats on Maug, Asuncion, Agrihan, Pagan, Alamagan, Guguan, Sarigan, and Anatahan. In subsequent surveys of the Mariana fruit bat on Anatahan, Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, Pagan, and Agrihan population sizes (4250 individuals) appeared to have declined by 37% (or 2775 individuals) when compared with the previous counts (7025 individuals) of the same islands.  A more recent study was conducted in 2001 across the archipelago using different methods (i.e. aerial surveys) and results were significantly different compared to the aforementioned studies.  This was likely related to different methods used, and thus results from 2001 were not used by USFWS for the population comparisons over time.  Aside from recent aerial surveys of some single islands, current information on population status of the Mariana fruit bat throughout the northern islands of the Mariana Archipelago is limited.  Therefore, we propose to conduct a multi-island assessment of the Marian fruit bat on Anatahan, Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, Pagan, Agrihan, Asuncion, Maug, and Uracas of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, over a 2-month field period from late May to mid-July 2010.  Ultimately, these assessments will assist in providing information that is required by federal regulations to properly determine the potential impacts that will occur from the movement of military resources to the Territory of Guam and the CNMI.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Objective 1 (Surveys of tree roosts):PI will review literature from previous surveys conducted on Anatahan, Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, Pagan, Agrihan, Asuncion, Maug, and Uracas, as well as consult with G. Wiles to help locate historic roosting sites and provide insight to areas that have not been surveyed. Information on general areas of roost sites will also be gathered from reconnaissance conducted by USFWS using novel methods that may include surveys from the air or from boats around the perimeters of the islands. Depending on the size of the island and number of researchers available, islands will be surveyed systematically in areas where roosts have been documented historically or from air or boat reconnaissance.  Incidental findings of smaller roost sites, as well as evidence of foraging areas will be recorded. Related information on the food source and neighboring habitat will be recorded.  Upon discovery, each roost site will be flagged, temporarily marked, photographed, geographically referenced by Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and its position sketched on base maps in the field. Objective 2 (Visual count-based estimates of colony sizes):  Assessment of the Mariana fruit bat will focus on direct counts of bats and are best conducted when bats are at their roosting trees during the morning when bats are less likely to move to another roost.  Bats will be counted from the best possible viewing distances and suitable vantage points.  Once a roost is located, direct counts of individuals will be taken through high quality spotting scopes, binoculars, and digital photography.  Using spotting scopes and binoculars, number of individuals will be counted and tallied on datasheets by at least two observers simultaneously. At the same time, digital photographs will be taken to provide a repeatable count and record of individuals observed.  Photographs will be viewed by at least two observers and bats will be counted independently. Departure counts will be conducted to compare results from previous studies as well as for comparison with current and novel methods. Departure counts will be conducted using binoculars or spotting scopes from the best vantage points and will include at least two observers. Bats leaving the roost will be counted visually in fading light against the sky or lightest background. In addition, a digital video camera will be used to record departures of individuals from roost and digital data will be saved for later repeated counts by at least two people.  Observers of the video will count the number of bats in real time on the recording, and (if possible) count bats by freezing frames or watching in slower motion. All counts (i.e., direct and departure) of bats made by each observer and from digital data will be averaged per night and an associated standard error will be calculated.  This will provide an estimate of observer variability in counts per night. Depending on number of visits and available observers, an overall colony size estimate determined from departure counts for each roost will be obtained by averaging across all multiple observers and across multiple nights to include information on both observer and day-to-day variability.Objective 3 (Increase baseline natural history information): Determine and record on standard data sheets, as best as possible, the age class, sex, reproductive status, and number of bats using tree roosts.  Reproductive assessment will be based on presence and number of young present. When possible, size, condition (e.g. amount of neighboring foliage vs. denuded branches), types of trees used as roosts, and associated data will be documented. If carcasses or skeletons of bats found dead during searches for roosts, they will be salvaged and deposited into an accredited museum, such as the federal repository of the USGS Biological Survey Collection at the Museum of Southwestern Biology.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Assessment of the threatened Mariana fruit bat (Pteropus m. mariannus) on Anatahan, Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, Pagan, Agrihan, Asuncion, Maug, and Uracas, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands will focus on three main objectives:  1)  Conduct surveys for previously known and new roosts by aerial surveys and ground searches, including implementing new techniques developed by Division of Fish and Wildlife; 2) Make visual count-based estimates of colony sizes based on location of roosts using new and standardized methods, as well as implement previous methods (e.g., departure counts) to provide continuity between current and historic data; 3) Increase baseline natural history information such as habitat preference, possible reproduction, and salvage of specimens found dead for accession into accredited research museum collections.  To maximize the scientific information gathered while conducting research on these remote islands and as a USGS in-kind contribution, we propose to conduct secondary assessments of select taxa during downtime periods of the Mariana fruit bat surveys.  These assessments will include passive acoustic sampling after dark (when fruit bat counts are completed) for the insectivorous for the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Emballonura semicaudata rotensiss), a candidate for listing by USFWS (2007).  This species once known to occur throughout the CNMI, but has gone extinct except for its presence on Aguiguan.  Prey items of this insectivorous bat will also be collected incidentally to determine if food items similar to those on Aguiguan are available to sustain populations.  From the insect assessments there is the potential of documenting invasive insect species (e.g., coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros) that may have adverse impacts to tree species used by the Mariana fruit bat.  New and pertinent information from these assessments will be included into the final report.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Because of sensitive data related to the threatened Mariana fruit bat, primary products will be provided, at the request of USFWS, as an Administrative Report and delivered in electronic and hard copy formats.  Information in the Administrative Report will include specific locations (GPS coordinates) of roosts, number of individuals counted and variability in counts, natural history, and other related data as proposed in this plan.  Digital images and video footage that serve as records for repeatable counts will be provided to USFWS, the point of contact and agency, on a digital media source.  Electronic copies of pertinent raw data collected during period of study will be provided.  Portions of raw data, final report and observations may be published separately in appropriate journals.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings During June and July 2010 the islands of Anatahan, Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, Pagan, Agrihan, Asuncion, and Maug were surveyed for the presence of the Mariana fruit bat using methods developed by Mildentein and Boland (2010).  Because of a variety of logistical problems, including the eruption of a submarine volcano that resulted in evacauation and of some islands, efforts were delayed for several weeks.  After the threat to safety had subsided, researchers were allowed to initiate their efforts but at a shortened time schedule.  Between June and July 2010 Anatahan, Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, Pagan, Agrihan, Asuncion, and Maug were visited and we were able to document the presence of the Mariana fruit bat on each.  The overall maximum number of bats counted on Anatahan, Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, Pagan, Agrihan, Asuncion, and Maug combined, totaled 3,078 bats. The greatest number of individuals documented in 2010 for any island was for Pagan (1,017), followed by Agrihan (858), Asuncion (573) Guguan (226), Sarigan (157), Anatahan (150), Alamagan (86), and Maug (11). Each of these maximum counts are based on direct counts or counts from photographs, with the exception of Guguan and Anatahan. On Guguan, 226 bats were counted during an exit count of a roost that was positioned in a ravine on a northeast-facing cliff. A single roost on the west side of Anatahan was located by flying over the island via helicopter and estimated visually from the air to have about 150 bats.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments Current information on population status of the Mariana fruit bat throughout the northern islands of the Mariana Archipelago is limited (USFWS 2005). As part of a multiple-taxa assessment of the northern Mariana Islands (NMI), funded by the Department of Defense (DOD) and subcontracted from USFWS, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) formed a Mariana Fruit Bat Team (MFB) and conducted an assessment of the Mariana fruit bat (P. m. mariannus). The main objective of this study was to locate and conduct counts of P. m. mariannus on Anatahan, Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, Pagan, Agrihan, Asuncion, Maug, and Uracas of the NMI using a newly-developed protocol (Mildenstein and Boland 2010) and compare our counts to previous studies. Initial efforts were directed to areas where roosts had been previously documented, followed by searches for new locations by conducting ground searches, as well as aerial and boat surveys. Secondary objectives included the collection of natural history information, such as habitat preference and information on reproduction.  We used the Mildenstein and Boland (2010) protocols to assess populations on eight islands. However, because of limitations of time, resources, personnel, or other logistical issues, aspects of the protocol could not be implemented (e.g., replication of counts), thus no summary statistics were calculated. Information on the number of bats observed on each island is presented as the maximum number of bats counted by method 2 used. Maximum number of bats counted were not adjusted with a correction factor, as used in earlier studies (e.g., Johnson 2001, Worthington and others 2001, Cruz and others 2000a-f, Wiles and others 1989).  The overall maximum number of bats counted on Anatahan, Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, Pagan, Agrihan, Asuncion, and Maug combined, totaled 3,078 bats. The greatest number of individuals documented in 2010 for any island was for Pagan (1,017), followed by Agrihan (858), Asuncion (573) Guguan (226), Sarigan (157), Anatahan (150), Alamagan (86), and Maug (11). Each of these maximum counts are based on direct counts or counts from photographs, with the exception of Guguan and Anatahan. On Guguan, 226 bats were counted during an exit count of a roost that was positioned in a ravine on a northeast-facing cliff. A single roost on the west side of Anatahan was located by flying over the island via helicopter and estimated visually from the air to have about 150 bats.  Because earlier studies used different methods of counting and often included correction factors, it is difficult to make statistical comparisons between their minimum population estimates with maximum number of bats counted in this study. Although there are discrepancies between methods used across studies and it is difficult to make statistical comparisons across islands, a gross comparison of the values for Anatahan, as noted by Wiles and other (1989), Cruz and others (2000), Johnson (2001) and this study, show a notable decline in population size. However, it likely can be best explained by the eruption in 2003 that devastated much of the habitat and possibly the bats occurring on the island. Prior to the eruption Johnson (2001) noted that there was a population decline on Anatahan that resulted from feral ungulates destroying habitat.  Despite the intense efforts by the MFB team, it is likely that some colonies remain unknown. This paucity of information is mostly related to the limited amount of time and lack of resources available for each island. Furthermore, this study was conducted during a short time-period in June and July and it is possible that some colonies may move frequently and occupy different parts of the landscape throughout the year. Thus, the results from this study only represent a snapshot of time and space.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In 1999 and 2000, a survey of bats was conducted at El Malpais National Monument (ELMA) located in western New Mexico.  During this study, several species of bats were documented, including some that are known to use caves or lava tube formations as roosts.  Since this study, white-nose syndrome (WNS), a fungus-related disease, has been devastating populations of bat species that use caves and mines in the eastern United States.  This disease is rapidly moving westward and has the potential to have an impact on the local populations of bats at ELMA.  To better plan and manage for the possible arrival of WNS, it is imperative to have current information on the occurrence of bat species and the type of habitat they use on the park.  These data will serve as a current benchmark on the status of the existing species and can be compared to historic, as well as future studies.  Additionally, data from this study will contribute to the natural history information (e.g., seasonal occurrence, reproductive condition) of bats in New Mexico and Southwest that can be used for conservation and habitat management.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology This study will be initiated with a review of the literature, as well as the database of species encountered during the 1999-2000 bat assessment conducted US Geological Survey.  Field studies that include acoustic monitoring and mist-netting bats over open water sources will target early emergence of bats during late winter and early spring to allow for detection of hibernacula across the landscape and fungal hyphae, respectively. Mist netting will continue throughout the spring and likely the summer of 2013.  All efforts are dependent on local weather conditions and available funding.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The purpose of this study is to locate new hibernacula, as well as provide an up-to-date assessment of bats and their micro-biota that occur on El Malpais National Monument.  This study will provide new insight to what species may be affected by the potential occurrence of white-nose syndrome.  Moreover, information from this study will provide information that is critical for managing habitat of the park as well as insight to what species may be using the lava tube systems.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Primary products will include a final report of findings that include any information on the potential presence of white-nose syndrome, specific locations (GPS coordinates) of mist-net sites, number of individuals netted and related natural history information.  Electronic copies of pertinent raw data collected during period of study will be provided.  Findings will also be published separately in appropriate journals.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease that has been devastating to populations of hibernating bats in the eastern United States and has spread westward. It was first reported in the winter of 20062007 near Albany, New York. Since then, it has spread westward to western Kentucky and Tennessee, and in 2010, the WNS-related fungus (Geomyces destructans) was documented in western Oklahoma. Given the proximity of G. destructans to El Malpais National Monument and its effects on hibernating bats, the monument contacted the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to conduct an assessment for the presence of this fungus or related disease on bats. During the late winter and early spring of 2011, the USGS Arid Lands Field Station initiated mist-netting efforts at El Malpais National Monument and on adjacent lands belonging to Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service (FS). Field efforts were conducted during spring and summer but were concentrated in the early spring, when the presence of the fungus or its effects would be detectable compared to warmer and later periods of the spring and summer. However, irregular wind speeds, as well as cold temperatures and snow, likely had a negative effect on net captures and success during the spring. Nonetheless, during this assessment, 421 bats belonging to 8 species were documented at El Malpais National Monument and adjacent lands. None of these captures showed evidence for the presence of G. destructans or white-nose syndrome, but it is possible that the subtle signs of some infections may not have been observed.  Laguna de Juan Garcia, a large pool located in the northwestern corner of El Malpais National Monument, was netted 4 times throughout the spring and summer and a total of 155 bats were captured. Laguna de Juan Garcia also had the greatest number of captures (79 bats) during one night compared to the other sites netted and had the greatest species diversity of 8 species netted, not including Euderma maculatum (Spotted Bat) that was detected by its audible calls as it flew overhead. Laguna de Juan Garcia is an important site to bats because of its accessibility by all known occurring species, including the less-maneuverable Tadarida brasiliensis (Brazilian Free-tailed Bat) that is known to form large colonies in the park. Laguna de Juan Garcia is also important as a more permanent water source during drought conditions in the earlier part of the spring and summer, as observed in 2011.  Although efforts during 2011 did not result in the detection of G. destructans or WNS on bats at El Malpais National Monument and adjacent lands, monitoring for the spread of this disease should continue. Such efforts should include mist-netting as well as subterranean monitoring and locating unknown hibernacula. In addition to monitoring for WNS, future studies also should include understanding use of forests and woodlands as summer roosts by bats; investigating ecological and economic impacts of bats as insect predators; and investigating the effects of fire on the landscape and its impacts to bats. These will allow future studies to provide better insight needed for habitat management at the Monument.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED - NPS: Review of State of Texas Mine: A Comparison of 2010 Modified Cupola and Cable-net Video Surveys and Supporting Data, Prepared by WestLand Resources, Inc. and Arizona Game and Fish Department, 2010\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The State of Texas Mine (SOTM) is located on Coronado National Memorial (CORO) and is used seasonally as a day roost by the lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae). As part of a mitigation agreement between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and theNational Park Service (NPS) for the mine, the entrance was fitted with a modified cupola-gate structure in 2010 to replace a cable-net closure. Cable-net closures were installed at many abandoned mine sites within CORO in 1988, including three of the mine adits that are part of the SOTM complex. However, the cable-net hindered the emergence of the bat colony, the fraying cables posed a danger to individual bats, and the cable-net could be easily breached by humans (Foster 2008). In addition to ensuring the safety of the bats using the mine, the replacement of the cable-net was also driven by the need for additional security for law enforcement and park staff tasked with preventing illegal human ingress to the mine.Prior to construction of the modified cupola-gate, field tests were conducted by other researchers to determine the best possible gate structure and appropriate spacing between bars for use by L. yerbabuenae. The modified cupola was completed in 2010. To determine the effectiveness of the new gate on bat use, WestLand Resources, Inc. (WestLand) and Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD) were contracted to conduct surveys and initiate a monitoring effort at the new cupola-gate todetermine if the new gate met the success criteria listed in the Biological Opinion (BO) by the USFWS (2010). These criteria were: (1) the colony size meets expectations based on regional population trends, with evaluations by CORO staff and the USFWS; (2) there are no massive pileups and dead or injured bats are very rare; and (3) the number of bats per minute exiting the mine is comparable to the rate recorded with the cable-net (USFWS 2010). In addition to monitoring activity and use of the gate by L. yerbabuenae, WestLand and AGFD (2010) compared video footage of the monitoring effort in 2010 with earlier video recorded from 2003-2006 during monitoring of the previous cable-net closure. WestLand and AGFD (2010) reported on their findings and conclusions in a report entitled, State of Texas Mine: A comparison of 2010 modified cupola and cable-net video surveys. Leptonycteris yerbabuenae is listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) as an endangered species throughout its range in the United States. Leptonycteris yerbabuenae is a colonial-roosting species known to occur at only three maternity roosts in the U.S. and at approximately 40 total roosts across its rangein Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico. Therefore, effects at one or two roost locations could have a major effect on the overall population.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology A site visit to the State of Texas Mine will occur in August 2010 to assess the structure, surrounding habitat, and bat activity that will help familiarize reviewers with the subject matter of the report by WestLand Resources Inc. and Arizona Game & Fish.  The report will be reviewed for scientific vigor and writing style.A review of video footage recorded and analyzed by WestLand Resources Inc. and Arizona Game & Fish will involve frame by frame counts of select dates.  These counts will be compared to those by WestLand Resources Inc. and Arizona Game & Fish to determine level of accuracy.  Video will be reviewed for quality and recommendations will be made for improving future work.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Because of the special conservation status of Leptonycteris yerbabuenae, USGS was requested to provide a critical review of the report produced by WestLand and AGFD (2010) based on FORT biologists's expertise of monitoring bats and knowledge of the unique biology of L. yerbabuenae. In addition to a scientific review of the report, FORT biologists were also requested to review video footage and raw data collected by WestLand and AGFD (2010).\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan A final report will be presented to Coronado National Memorial upon completion.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Review of the analyses and report by WestLand Resources Inc. and Arizona Game & Fish showed that methods used and quality of videos recorded were sub-par and analyzed data were inaccurate.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle COMPLETED - Range-wide Monitoring Protocols for Prairie Dogs in the United States\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem One of the greatest challenges for conserving grassland, prairie scrub, and shrub-steppe ecosystems is maintaining prairie dog populations across the landscape.  Of the four species of prairie dogs found in the United States, the Utah prairie dog (Cynomys parvidens) is listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as threatened, the Gunnisons prairie dog (C. gunnisoni) is a candidate for listing in a portion of its range, and the black-tailed prairie dog (C. ludovicianus) and white-tailed prairie dog (C. leucurus) have each been petitioned for listing at least once in recent history.  Although U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) determined listing is not warranted for either black-tailed prairie dog or white-tailed prairie dog, the petitions and associated reviews demonstrated the need for the States to monitor and manage for self sustaining populations. In response to these findings, a multi-State conservation effort was initiated for the non-listed species which included several proposed actions:  develop a range-wide monitoring protocol for each species using a statistically valid sampling procedure that would allow comparable analyses across States, and monitor their status every 3-5 years depending upon the species.  To date, all eleven States are currently monitoring prairie dog status; however, for some species, the inconsistency in survey methodology has made it difficult to compare data year-to-year or State-to-State.  In 2008, the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA) recognized that states were devoting considerable effort and funding to monitor prairie dog populations, yet the methods used were inconsistent across states and some methods were subject to criticism, especially for the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). WAFWA also recognized that because of the different methodologies used, it was difficult to consolidate this information in a statistically rigorous manner to monitor progress towards achieving the target objectives as identified in the Multi-State Conservation Plan. Standardized methodologies were needed that would be used by all states so that progress could be measured towards meeting the target objectives of the Multi-State Conservation Plan.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology A prairie dog survey methodology workshop was held in Fort Collins, Colorado, during January 2528, 2010. A panel of 6 experts in the field of quantitative biology, population biology, species biology, and biostatistics were appointed to (1) review the current survey methodologies used by each state and for each species and (2) provide WAFWA with survey methodology recommendations for each species of prairie dog. Prior to the workshop, all 11 states were asked to respond to a set of questions regarding their survey objectives and methods and provide any additional information they would like the panel to consider. Most states also provided oral presentations at the workshop, as did one tribe and one non-governmental organization. A report will be prepared that presents the panels recommendations to standardize survey methodologies among the states for each of the four species of prairie dogs.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle FWS: Bat Banding Clearinghouse\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The U.S. Government administered, coordinated, and maintained a Bat Banding Program (BBP) from 1932 to 1972. More than 2 million bat bands were issued by the BBP during this time of which approximately 1.5 million were applied to 36 species of bats by scientists, their students, and colleagues in many locations in North America. Many interesting facts about basic bat biology were discovered by the application of these bands including homing behavior, return rates, distances bats are capable of traveling, longevity, seasonal migrations, hibernation ecology, mortality and survival rates, and reproductive behavior. However, during the program, banders noticed numerous worrisome and deleterious effects on bat health and survival. The problem of injuries to bats was deemed so serious that a moratorium was placed on bat banding in 1972. Since then, studies using banded bats have continued by using privately purchased and less injurious bands. Lipped aluminum bands with a 2.9-mm gap made by Lambournes, Ltd., Leominster, United Kingdom (now owned by Porzana) have been used in several studies since the BBP with fewer band injuries, if properly applied. Currently, there is a research study being conducted in the northeastern U.S. using double-marking techniques and specially designed pliers to better apply aluminum bands to the wings of bats in an effort to assess injuries to bats (Al Hicks, personal communication). The need to mark bats individually in order to assess life history parameters and movements is especially important as threats from white-nose syndrome (WNS) and wind energy development continue to negatively affect bats.  Responses to these threats at the population level can only be discerned through measurements made possible through marking.    Although disparate bat banding efforts are ongoing, no coherent strategy, official clearinghouse or coordination program exists in North America, despite the recognized need. A major recommendation made in a Summary and Analysis of the U.S. Government Bat Banding Program in 2008 (http://www.fort.usgs.gov/Products/Publications/pub_abstract.asp?PubID=22435) was to develop a national clearinghouse for banded bats in order to optimize information obtained from marked bats. The U.S. Geological Survey, Fort Collins Science Center (USGS-FORT) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Great Lakes-Big Rivers Region (FWS-R3), propose to develop a clearinghouse for banded bats beginning with the endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis).\n",
      "\t\tMethodology To accomplish this task, FORT will send each Indiana bat permittee (intending to capture individuals) bat bands and pliers for band application. FORT is also currently developing a Bat Population Data (BPD) Project, which will eventually have a Banding Application. In this Web-based application, individual banders will be able to log on securely to the database and enter their banding information.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives 1. Determine bat band requirements and develop a uniquely identifiable marking (lettering, coloring and numbering) system to apply to the bands. Purchase bat bands and pliers.   2. Distribute bat bands and pliers to each Indiana bat permit applicant received from Region 3.3. Enter available historic banding data into the centralized database.4. Accept reports of banded bats and enter the data into a centralized database (until Step 5 is completed).5. In conjunction with the ongoing development of the Bat Population Data (BPD) Project, develop a secure Web-based Banding Application for researchers to be able to submit information on bats that were banded, recovered, returned, or recaptured. The database application will have fields based on the current FWS banding datasheet required by Region 3 permit reports. The application will only be accessible to individual permittees and by the FWS.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle The North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat)\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Despite their importance and the many threats facing their populations [e.g., white-nose syndrome (WNS), climate change, wind energy development, and habitat loss and fragmentation], there are currently no national programs to monitor and track bat populations in North America. A statistically rigorous and nationally coordinated bat monitoring program is critical for determining the impacts of the many stressors on bat populations, as well as for determining the efficacy of management actions taken to conserve bat populations (i.e., adaptive management). The objectives of the North American Bat Monitoring Program (or NABat) are to: 1) provide the architecture for coordinated bat monitoring to support local, regional and range-wide inferences about trends in bat populations and abundances in response to WNS, climate, wind energy, and habitat loss, and 2) provide managers and policy makers with the information they need on bat population trends to effectively manage bat populations, detect early warning signs of population declines, and estimate extinction risk.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Three workshops were held to develop the monitoring program. Two occurred in FY13 and a third took place at the FORT in November 2014. A small group of statisticians (12-15) with expertise in large-scale monitoring designs and bat biologists will participate in these workshops with the goal of developing a national bat monitoring protocol. The workshops had scientists and researchers from multiple agencies including USFWS, USGS, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, and the University of Tennessee, National Institute of Mathematical and Biological Synthesis. There were participants from Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom to present their views on national monitoring programs.FORT will provide program coordination, data management, and disseminate information from statistical modeling efforts on status and trends of North American Bats. The NABat inferential framework is predicated on making inferences about species distributions and local abundance and the associated state variables driving changes in these population parameters (e.g., site occupancy, local colonization, and local extinction probabilities). Inferences on species distributions will made using single and multi-species dynamic occupancy models with data collected from passive stationary acoustic sampling, acoustic data collected from mobile transects, and site occupancy data from colony surveys. Inferences on local abundance and changes in this parameter will be made using a combination of generalized linear and non-linear mixed models, binomial mixture models, and extensions of the Dail-Madsen population dynamics model with count data collected from colony surveys at hibernacula and maternity colonies. In addition, FORT will explore the utility of implementing integrated population models and extensions of full-life cycle models currently being used to estimate population parameters for neotropical migrants.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The objectives will be to (1) design a statistically robust and logically feasible probabilistic sampling frame for bat population monitoring at local and national scales; (2) produce detailed protocols that can be followed by biologists with State, Provincial, and Federal agencies, Tribes, and partner organizations to monitor bats; and, (3) develop the necessary infrastructure to provide a web-based application to store data collected from local and national monitoring efforts, (4) develop web-based tools to document grid cell selection and facilitate collaborative sampling efforts, and (5) provide reliable information on status and trends of North American bats based on robust statistical analyses.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan The NABat Team has presented the Plan at WNS workshops and North American Society for Bat Research conferences. A US Forest Service General Technical Report was finalized and published summer 2015. This document provides details on the organizational structure, roles and responsibilities, the sampling framework and design, data management, and analyses for the NABat program.In 2017, FORT presented programmatic updates to the broader bat community at the Bat Echolocation Symposium, Western Bat Working Group, USFWS Regional and National WNS working group monthly phone calls, and The National WNS Meeting. FORT will continue to present programmatic updates in FY2018 through the newly developed NABat Listserv, public-facing web pages on the NABat website (www.nabatmonitoring.org), and participation in the 2017 Batweek Signature Event. Also, program documentation, guidance documents outlining SOPs for collecting and analyzing survey data, and 'How to...' documentation for NABat Partners will be made available through the NABat website.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings In FY14, funding was secured to coordinate pilot studies for the NABat program. Initial pilot surveys were conducted in 2014; greatly expanded pilot surveys occurred in 2015-16 in 8 western states in collaboration with Bat Conservation International (AZ, CA, CO, ID, MT, TX, UT, WA) and in North Carolina and South Carolina. in FY17, data were collected following NABat protocol in about 39 states and 10 Canadian provinces.NABat combines several new and ongoing sampling schemes, including maternity and hibernacula counts, acoustic surveys along driving transects, and passive stationary acoustic surveys joined in a common sampling framework consisting of a Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) draw of 10x10 km grid cells across Canada and the USA. This master sample provides an ordered list of spatially balanced grid cells within each state and province. Master sample shapefiles with guidance on how to choose grid cells were sent to 24 states and 10 provinces that indicated interest in conducting pilot surveys during the summer and fall of 2014. In 2017, these resources have been made available on the newly developed NABat website (www.nabatmonitoring.org). Data will be managed by the USGS and data workflows and applications are being developed. In 2017, FORT finished development of the NABat Project Database, a downloadable desktop database for users to manage all their NABat survey data. This database also serves as the required application for uploading data through the NABat website. FORT has developed a NABat Master Database that will store NABat survey data. Once sufficient data are available, NABat will publish periodic \"State of North American Bats\" reports, which will provide updates on changes in bat species distributions and relative abundance.  In FY17, an NABAt Coordinator was hired and funding was secured for the development of an integrated mapping service linking, for the first time, NABat survey data and historical data on bats, with up-to-date WNS diagnostic and surveillance data. Funding was also secured to help collate historical colony count survey data from all available sources across the US. These data will housed in the NABat Master database.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments The NABat Team met for two workshops in FY13 and a third third workshop in November 2014. The \"Plan for a North American Bat Monitoring Program, NABat\" was published as a General Technical Report in summer 2015 by the USFS. Approximately 10 states participated in pilot acoustic surveys during the summer of 2014. Expanded pilot surveys are being conducted in 2015 and 2016 by 8 western states and North Carolina and South Carolina. In 2017, data are being collected following NABat protocol in about 39 states and 10 Canadian provinces.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Completed:QRP - Evaluating the Effectiveness of Wildlife Monitoring Technologies at a Solar Power Tower Facility\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Solar towers are an emerging technology with the potential to become an important source of renewable energy.  However, because this technology is so new, there is uncertainty about potential impacts to wildlife, specifically birds and bats.  Solar towers produce electricity by using an array of large, movable mirrors, called heliostats, to concentrate energy from the sun onto a receiver at the top of a central heat-absorbing tower.  The receiver heats water inside the tower to create steam which is then piped to a conventional turbine to generate electricity.  Sunlight reflected from heliostats toward the tower is referred to as solar flux.  Flux is greatest at the tower receiver, where temperatures can reach more than 1,000F (538C), but flux dissipates with increasing distance from the tower.  The potential impacts of concentrated solar power facilities on wildlife are not well known.  Flux generated at solar towers has the potential to burn or blind birds, in addition to possible collision hazard associated with the tower and highly reflective heliostats.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology NOROCK and FORT biologists will travel with the necessary monitoring equipment to the Ivanpah solar facility near Las Vegas, Nevada for a 10-day field visit in autumn of 2014 (peak period of bird and bat migration).  During the visit, we will deploy a portable radar unit and two types of thermal video cameras to monitor day and night bird and bat activity during 7-8 days of the visit, as well as a near-infrared (NIR) surveillance camera and illuminator for additional monitoring at night.  We will collect radar data on the flight paths of flying animals moving through the study site.  The radar itself is a Furuno 2127BB all-weather, vehicle-mounted, portable unit designed for marine applications.  It runs off 120 VAC current usually supplied by a low-noise generator, has a maximum biological operating range of ~6 km, and sweeps through the airspace updating the locations of flying animals every 2.5 seconds.  Radar sampling locations within the study site will be determined in advance, based on detection geometry and layout of the solar facility.  Data will be saved as imagery showing the tracks of flying animals as well as the solar facility structures.   Radar data will enable us to compute an animals location, speed, direction, and approximate height.  Post-processing of radar data will require considerable human screening to identify corresponding observations between radar and video, and to quantify behaviors generally.  Post-processing may be aided by automation processing software pending its availability.We will use a camera sensitive to very low-light conditions (0.00003 lux) in the near-infrared wavelength range (700 -1,000 nm), as well as surveillance and scientific-grade cameras that image in the thermal spectrum of infrared light and thus need no source of illumination.  The NIR camera is an electron-multiplying, charge-coupled device with a focal plane array detector of 680 x 500 pixels and an adjustable lens and field of view.  Resolution of thermal cameras is similar or higher.  Both types of cameras are weatherproof and can be left unattended all night if 120 VAC current (standard outlet) is available.  Cameras record 30-60 video frames per second in digital format directly to portable computers and removable storage devices.  Night-time airspace around the solar tower will be lit for the NIR camera by an eye-safe laser illuminator operating in the non-visible NIR spectrum.  Laser illuminators will be set away from the tower pointing upward.  Imagery will be stored to hard drives and backed up regularly.  Analysis of video imagery will be labor intensive (estimated 80 hours analysis time), but the motion analysis software we have developed will be used to batch process video footage in its native format and flag files containing targets of interest, thereby facilitating review of collected imagery.  When possible, we will backtrack any birds or bats seen on video flying near the solar tower through the airspace monitored by radar to determine their approach to the structure.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources - The USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center (NOROCK) and the Fort Collins Science Center (FORT) will provide technical assistance to the USFWS Region 8 to conduct a pilot study assessing the efficacy of using radar, infrared videography, and thermal videography for monitoring the daytime and nighttime behavior of birds and bats around one of the first solar tower facilities to become operational in the United States.  The specific objectives of the project are:  1) evaluate the performance of various video and radar systems within a 10-day period to monitor avian and bat behavior at an existing power tower; 2) determine the benefits and limitations associated with these remote monitoring systems in an extremely hot desert environment and test their effectiveness as monitoring tools to document bird and bat behavior under solar flux conditions; 3) evaluate whether radar and video systems would be appropriate for future use in monitoring efforts to document pre- and post-construction avian and bat behavior at a facility; and 4) produce a manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal that provides recommendations for future monitoring efforts at concentrated solar facilities based on the results of the pilot research.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan The primary product of this effort will be a manuscript submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

      "\t\tTaskTitle Assessing impacts to ecosystems from uranium mining in the Grand Canyon region\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In 2012, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar withdrew approximately one million acres of federal land near the Grand Canyon from additional uranium mining development until the year 2032, citing uncertainties regarding the effects of uranium mining on the Grand Canyon, its people, wildlife and water resources.  The decision to withdraw federal lands from further mining activity allows time to study the potential effects of uranium mining. The USGS is the lead Department of the Interior bureau tasked with developing the science to address these critical data gaps.  USGS scientists with different areas of expertise are coming conducting studies to address information gaps related to the effects of uranium exploration and mining activities on people and environmental resources.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology As part of an effort to determine type and habitat use by insects at the Canyon Mine detention pond, light traps were placed around the borders of the pond and sampled each night for the first week in June 2013.  Samples were identified and sent to CERC for contaminant analyses.  Concurrently, mist-nets were deployed to capture bats flying over and drinking from the detention pond. Tissue samples were sent to CERC to be analyzed for contaminants.  Fecal samples from bats were analyzed to determine what insect prey were consumed.  In addition to mist-netting, habitat use by bats at Canyon Mine detention pond was documented through acoustic sampling.  Ultrasonic calls of bats were recorded nightly from approximately sunset to sunrise during the same sampling period of insects and mist-netting but continued for one year until May 2014.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Gulf Islands National Seashore stretches across 160 miles of coastline along the Gulf of Mexico. Four species of endangered sea turtles and one species of threatened sea turtle inhabit this region. These turtles come ashore, bury their clutch of eggs in the sand, and then return to sea. About two months later, hatchlings emerge from the nest with an immediate biological mandatea mad dash to horizons light and the open seas it indicates. In the past, this instinctual drive toward the light was an effective strategy for reaching the sea. The exponential growth of light pollution over the past century has increasingly diminished the success of this drive, often drawing hatchlings toward the brighter lights of society and away from the Gulf of Mexico. This correlation between light pollution and hatchling disorientation has been noted since the 1950s, but the correlation with blue wavelengths of light and disorientation has not yet been well studied. It is hypothesized that the hatchlings are most sensitive to blue wavelengths of light. To test this correlation and determine peak sensitivity to blue wavelengths, Gulf Islands National Seashore with the help of the NPS night skies team and the U.S. Geological Survey, developed Turtle T.H.i.S. (Teens Helping in the Seashore) to address this information deficit and to engage students and the community in the study.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The park is taking a twofold approach to assessing the correlation between sea turtle disorientation and sensitivity to light conditions. Sky Quality Meters (SQM), which are used to measure light intensity, have a reach of 200 meters, so students sample three points along transects placed every 400 meters along the beach beginning at a randomized start point. Measurements at the three points, which are placed at the mean high tide line, the dune toe slope, and the dune peak, include a complete hemispheric measurement of light intensity. This methodology provides an all-encompassing set of measurements spanning the Gulf coast shoreline of two islands. In addition to these measurements, students fine-tune the points for disorientation comparisons by measuring the light conditions at each individual nest site. To keep the data as close to the probable light conditions the sea turtles would have experienced, measurements are taken within a 20% range of the lunar phase during which the nest was originally laid or hatched. In this way, we have site-specific data to compare to the incidence of disorientation records as measured by the resource management division of the park. All of these data are then analyzed by a US Geological Survey quantitative biologist.  To address the hypothesis that sea turtles are most sensitive to blue light wavelengths generated by anthropogenic sources, each SQM unit is equipped with two metersone with a filter transparent to blue light only and one with no filter. These units are outfitted to create the Turtle T.H.i.S. kit with a tripod, leveler, and mount, to measure the prevailing light conditions 360 degrees around a horizontal plane. The angled altitude of the unit is then adjusted upward, and another round of measurements is taken. This process is repeated two more times, completing the dataset for that site.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives The cooperator will provide expertise and assistance in the areas of sampling design and data analysis for the new in-service citizen science program called Turtle T.H.I.S., a sea turtle research and monitoring program at the Gulf Islands National Seashore, Florida.Specifically, the cooperator will work jointly with personnel from the NPS Night Skies Division and NPS Gulf Islands National Seashore to:1.

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem America is under siege by many harmful species of plants, animals and diseases.  The current environmental, economic, and health-related costs of invasive species could exceed $120 billion per year, more than all other natural disasters combined.  Hundreds of new species from other countries are introduced intentionally or accidentally into the U.S. each year (Kartesz 2001).  Based on past experience, 10-15% can be expected to establish free-living populations and about 1% can be expected to cause significant impacts to ecosystems, native species, economic productivity, and/or human health.  The increasing threat of new introductions intensifies the need for scientists, managers, and the many stakeholders affected by invasive species to rally together to build better systems for invasion prevention, improve early detection of invaders, track established invaders, and coordinate containment, control, and effective habitat restoration.  Important questions include what will be the next major invader and what should managers be on the lookout for?  Examples of projects include development of watch lists for the National Park Service Exotic Plant Management Teams, potential future invaders to Alaska for USFWS and other management agencies, and evaluating the potential outcomes of various management options for buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris L. syn Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link) to meet management objectives in Saguaro National Park.A Resource for Advanced Modeling (RAM) has now been established to:Facilitate collaborative research within the USGS and the wider research community, bringing together remote sensing and climate forecasting experts, habitat modelers, field ecologists, and land managers in a synergistic environment to generate habitat suitability models.Coordinate research and modeling in the areas of  prevention, early detection and rapid assessment, promoting consistent and comparable inventory and monitoring designs and methods, advancing control and restoration technologies, and developing predictive models (ecological forecasting capabilities) by integrating high-resolution remote sensing and environmental mapping, state-of-the-art spatial and temporal modeling, and high-performance computing.Provide technical assistance to states, local government and non-government organizations, land and resource managers, scientists, and the public on all aspects of invasive species science.Develop an extensive outreach program to provide modeling assistance through the VisTrails: Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling program we have developed.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We are developing decision support modeling capabilities.  This modeling framework will combine state and transition simulation models with economic information to develop a decision support model to predict how climate change and varying management strategies may affect the presence and severity of invasions. These decision support models will serve as tools to inform management decisions by linking landscape level invasion outcomes to management scenarios.  Additionally, we have taken the approach of automating and streamlining our own internal processes for constructing habitat models.  This allows for consistency, efficiencies, and repeatability for the modeling exercises needed to extend habitat modeling to help meet the needs of DOI clients.  The foundation for this approach is our Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM), a module we developed within the workflow visualization software, VisTrails (http://vistrails.org/).   SAHM both expedites habitat modeling and helps maintain a record of the various input data, pre- and post-processing steps and modeling options incorporated in the construction of a species distribution model.  With this foundation we have the tools necessary to construct habitat models for DOI clients in a timely manner and in such a way that stakeholders are: engaged in the construction of the model, building an understanding of the models strengths and weaknesses, and, thus, developing keen insight into the proper utilization of the model output.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a continental-scale research platform for discovering and understanding the impacts of climate change, land-use change, and invasive species on ecology. NEON will gather long-term data on ecological responses of the biosphere to changes in land use and climate, and on feedbacks with the geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. NEON is a national observatory, not a collection of regional observatories. It will consist of distributed sensor networks and experiments, linked by advanced cyberinfrastructure to record and archive ecological data for at least 30 years. Using standardized protocols and an open data policy, NEON will gather essential data for developing the scientific understanding and theory required to manage the nations ecological challenges. This US Geological Survey-NEON Science Liaison will be: (1) developing and testing biodiversity sampling protocols for the network of sites; (2) designing and integrating an analysis framework for NEONs grand ecological challenges related to invasive species; (3) continuing involvement on the NEON Program Review Committee for the National Science Foundation; and (4) serving a USGS science liaison with NEON.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle NRPP Decision Support System for buffelgrass management in a changing climate\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem African buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare syn. Cenchrus ciliaris) is an invasive grass spreading rapidly in the Sonoran Desert of southern Arizona and the Chihuahua Desert of West Texas, potentially impacting six parks in the Intermountain Region. Williams and Baruch (2000) call buffelgrass one of the worlds most notorious invaders.   One of these sites, Saguaro National Park (SNP) is surrounded by Tucson and other public lands, including Coronado National Forest and Ironwood Forest National Monument.  Buffelgrass has spread throughout Tucsons natural and urban areas below 5,000 feet.  Buffelgrass has the capacity to outcompete native vegetation and can form dense monocultures over time. In addition, buffelgrass is creating an unprecedented fire risk to a Sonoran Desert flora largely composed of fire-sensitive species (McDonald, McPherson 2011, 2013).  Fires in buffelgrass could calamitously convert desert vegetation into scrub grassland dominated by non-native species (Stevens, Falk 2009).   Left unchecked, buffelgrass can dominate the desert landscape and cause frequent, intense and fast-moving wildfires that threaten native plants and wildlife. The several native species are very susceptible to fire damage and quickly disappear from areas that burn regularly due to human caused factors, including buffelgrass invasion. This loss of habitat is exacerbated by direct mortality from wildfires that typically burn in the summer when native wildlife species are most active and breeding. Terrestrial herpetofauna characteristic of the southwestern deserts are often unable to escape the flames and high temperatures, and can suffer high mortality during wildfires (Esque et al. 2007). Other impacts are sedimentation of water sources in drainages caused by erosion from rainfall after intense wildfires and loss of small trees used for nesting. Fires burning with an intensity never seen before in these areas could also create serious threats to life, property, and other values in urban areas. Current buffelgrass distribution in the Tucson area is mostly in isolated patches, but these patches are growing and coalescing.  No buffelgrass fires have yet occurred in SNP because of that patchiness, but numerous brushfires have been fueled by buffelgrass in the Tucson area.  Buffelgrass has been noted as disrupting natural fire regimes in Australia, Hawaii, Texas, and Mexico (D'Antonio, Vitousek 1992; Franklin et al. 2006).Climate change is expected to exacerbate these risks.  Growth of cold-intolerant species is likely to be enhanced by predicted climate changes (Abatzoglou, Kolden 2011).  SNP was recently named one of Americas national parks most vulnerable to climate change, largely due to the increase spread of buffelgrass, enhanced by warmer temperatures, drier conditions, and variable precipitation events  (Saunders et al. 2009).  SNP actively controls buffelgrass and has made progress at small scales using manual and ground-based herbicide control. The park estimates that 2500 gross acres of buffelgrass have been controlled within SNP and approximately 1500 gross acres are currently under management. An additional 2000 acres are currently untreated and distributed throughout the park.  Following recent  completion of a Restoration Plan and Environmental Assessment with a signed Finding of No Significant Impact, the park will begin aerial spraying in the summer of 2014 to some remote, dense and inaccessible buffelgrass infestations. Additionally, several park and regional management plans identify invasive non-native plant species, specifically buffelgrass, as a management issue and propose mitigation (e.g., SNP Comprehensive Trails Plan, Fire Management Plan).  However, prioritizing where to control buffelgrass, predicting where buffelgrass will spread and understanding the role climate change will have in buffelgrass spread are still challenges for park managers.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology \n",
      "\t\tObjectives 1.Spatially determine the suitable habitat for buffelgrass establishment within SNP.2.Evaluate how habitat suitability within SNP may change with changing climate to determine if buffelgrass may become more or less of a problem in the future.3.Develop an estimate of the rate of spread of buffelgrass in SNP and compare this estimate to those developed for other areas in the region.4.Simulate the baseline (i.e. no treatment) spread of buffelgrass over a 20-year horizon.5.Given a variety of treatment scenarios, estimate the probability of reducing buffelgrass in the entire park or in priority areas within the park.6.Estimate the required funding-levels and treatment duration needed to reduce or eliminate buffelgrass within SNP or in priority areas within the park\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Causes of variation in hydrogen isotopes in a pelagic seabird\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Hydrogen isotopes values (&#948;D) have significantly influenced our understanding of the migratory patterns of birds and other mobile organisms. This results from a fortuitous and predictable inverse relationship between &#948;D of precipitation with increasing latitude that is conferred to a variety of avifauna, including birds, butterflies and bats. However, our understanding of factors other than latitude that influence &#948;D values is poor. Such factors likely include trophic level fractionation and physiological factors such as evaporative water loss. Marine organisms are not expected to show latitudinal variation in &#948;D because they rely on an isotopically homogeneous water source of 0 . This is why application of &#948;D to study movements of marine organisms is rare. Currently funded research uses isotopic (&#948;13C and &#948;15N) and genetic data to explore the ecology of the endangered Hawaiian Petrel (Pterodromasandwichensis) or HAPE. While geographic patterns of isotopic variation are not expected for a highly mobile pelagic seabird, we observed variation in &#948;13C and &#948;15Nvalues and genetic differences among HAPE colonies on different Hawaiian Islands. To explore factors that might influence our results (e.g. physiology), we obtained &#948;D data for HAPE flight feathers. Our preliminary data show startling trends such as a 50  difference from their water source (mean for Kauai colony; a difference of -25  is expected) and a 65  difference between colonies. These data caution that interpretations of &#948;D values to understand migration may be undermined by factors other than latitude. Thus, the overarching goal of this research is to assess factors (other than latitude) that influence the &#948;D values of birds. Because this species derives its water from the ocean, which is isotopically invariant across latitudes, relies on a diet consisting of prey from different trophic levels, and incurs metabolic stress during long distance foraging trips, we are able to investigate factors such as trophic position and physiological that may influence &#948;D.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Feather and muscle samples from cat-killed Hawaiian petrels will be acquired from project collaborators.  Dr. Stricker will be responsible for hydrogen isotope analysis of samples following established protocols at the CGG-FORT isotope lab in Denver.  All investigators will help analyze and interpret resulting data, present findings at scientific meetings, and publish results in scientific journals.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives 1. We will further document &#948;D variation among islands and tissue types (feather, claw, bone) from Hawaii, Kauai, Lanai, and Maui HAPE populations. The data from each tissue type and island will make a unique contribution to the overall study. Most samples derive from birds originating from the colony on Hawaii. The large sample size of all tissues from the Hawaii colony provides a statistically robust measure for the study. We have at least 10 individuals from each of the 3 other islands (Maui, Kauai and Lanai). Because flight feathers are grown at sea during the non-breeding season, analysis of the flight feather P1 (the innermost primary feather) provides an at-sea isotope value while claw taken at the end of the breeding season allows us to characterize the breeding season. Muscle is a common tissue used in isotope studies and, thus, will be useful for comparisons withpublished research. An understanding of bone collagen &#948;D data will allow future studies to reach back in time via skeletal remains. Contour feathers have been provided from satellite tracked birds and allow us to link isotope data to foraging locations.2. We will assess sources of variation in &#948;D. We will evaluate the influence of trophic level via analysis of prey items and the influence of water stress by comparingisotope values of individual birds.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Annual reports will be prepared per NSF requirements.  Results will be communicated at scientific meetings and manuscripts submitted for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. All digital and hardcopy data will be housed at the CGG Lab in Denver.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings 1. The dD of 41 HAPE feathers are startlingly different from their ultimate water source (up to 70  difference rather than the reported shift between precipitation and feather of (-25 ). In addition, there is a large separation between the average dD values of hatch years from the Kauai and Maui populations and adults from all islands and hatch years from Hawaii (a difference of 60  or more).  Because dD variation is not anticipated for marine organisms (they rely on an isotopically homogeneous water source of 0 ), this variation and the unexpectedly large difference between HAPE and its water source is compelling. These data caution that the interpretation of dD values in studies of continental bird migration is oversimplified. Such studies may be determined by factors other than latitude that influence the dD values of feathers.  2. Owing to the potential for obtaining data from ancient bones, we were also interested to know if isotope signals were preserved in collagen.  As was the case for feathers, the large difference in dD between adults and chicks exists for bone collagen, feather and muscle. Thus, the difference in dD is not a function of tissue type and we will be able to apply hydrogen isotope analyses to understand historical records. 3. We asked if trophic fractionation results in an isotopic shift that might influence our data. We compared isotope values of muscle of prey taken from regurgitations of HAPE from Maui to HAPE believed to have consumed these prey (i.e. HAPE chicks from Maui) and to HAPE that putatively had different diets (Lanai HAPE). The isotope values of the prey and putative consumers of the prey are similar. However, isotope values of both prey and individuals known to consume that differ from HAPE believed to consume other resources. This is consistent with our interpretation that Maui chicks differ in their diets from Kauai and Lanai adults. These data are a strong indication that dD values of consumers reflect diet and there is no substantive isotopic shift. 4. Evaporatory water loss may play an important role in controlling dD values. Water lost through evaporation is depleted in deuterium by ~50  relative to body water, which is too small to account for the range in our data. Variation in evaporative water loss is most likely to impose a difference in &#948;D values between hatch years and adults due to inherent differences in activity levels between the two age groups. Because we do not see a difference between adults and hatch years from Hawaii, this cannot be the only factor that controls variation in our &#948;D data. Hydrogen isotope fractionation might also occur when water is lost through salt glands. Furthermore, variation in salt load may result between individuals that primarily consume prey such as squid and crustaceans that are isosmotic with seawater and those that feed on hyposmotic teleost fish. The former case (consumption of isoosmotic prey) can result in a doubling of salt load for seabirds. Increasing salt load, in turn, results in increased salt gland excretion by petrels. If salt load influences HAPE dD values, teleost fish must be more important in the diet of Kauai hatch years relative to adults and hatch years from other islands. To test the hypothesis that the relative proportion of fish vs squid in diets influences dD values we are analyzing samples from Blackfooted albatross and Bullers shearwater. The Black-footed albatross consumes primarily neon flying squid while Bullers shearwater associated with the same fishery relies primarily on fish. The preliminary data show the expected difference in dD with Bullers shearwaters having lower isotope values that Blackfooted albatross.5. Data from this grant and another NSF grant will be used by HAPE biologists to identify conservation management strategies and will be included as part of a conservation management plan.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings 1. Reconstruction of polar bear diet is confounded by a high lipid diet; calibration studies at Washington State University have added critical insight and our key finding that dietary fat levels influence consumer-diet isotopic spacing appears to be broadly applicable to mammalian carnivores.  Future efforts are focused on modeling protein and lipid pathways simultaneously to generate quantitative diet estimates for free-ranging Chukchi Sea bears.2. Diet-tissue isotopic discrimination in Alaska Steller sea lions maintained on complex fish/invertebrate diets differs from our previous estimates based on nursing pups.  These data have been used to infer the diets of gestating females throughout the range.  We are currently developing a new modeling framework that should provide multi-annual diet estimates for nearly 500 animals sampled in the North Pacific over the last 5-10 years.3. We have shown the white-tailed ptarmigan, an endemic alpine species to the Rocky Mountains, to be a good integrator of global change.  Isotopic analyses of feather material collected over the last ~70 years, indicates that food resources may have changed due to atmospheric deposition of nutrients, but most of the observed change can be directly explained by recent (last ~50 years) changes in atmospheric chemistry, particularly CO2.4. In Denali National Park, wolves that have access to anadromous salmon tend to exploit this resource, leading to a paradigm shift in how this species has been traditionally perceived as an obligate ungulate predator.  Further, exploitation of salmon resources allows for increased carrying capacity above which would be supported locally by ungulates alone.5. Analysis of fatty acid and stable isotope composition in juvenile salmonids along an escapement gradient on the Kenai Peninsula, AK, has revealed a general lack of a saturating response with increased spawner returns.  This is in contrast to systems in the Pacific Northwest and has important management implications for salmon streams in this region of AK.  Additionally, a manuscript detailing the persistence of marine derived nutrients in Alaskan riverine ecosystems was published.  Results indicate that spawning salmon runs lead to short-term increases in dissolved inorganic nutrients.  However, marine derived nutrient levels in biota increased with spawner abundance and were maintained across seasons, demonstrating that this pulsed subsidy can be persistent and have important consequences for juvenile salmonid production.6. We have been studying the foraging ecology of bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay, FL using stable isotope techniques.  Initial efforts were focused on stock delineation.  We then published a manuscript that derived long-term trends in foraging ecology from tooth samples.    These data are derived from isotopic analysis of tooth dentin obtained from a population that has been intensively studied for 40+ years.  After age-rectifying teeth, we have an approximate 70 year record of foraging ecology.  Results indicate that animals track seagrass productivity, but perturbations have obscured this record through time, including waste water discharge and commercial fishing activities.  A third paper has been published on the isotopic niche width by gender and age class, which is insightful in that females and males appear to divide up resources in a systematic fashion.  Lastly, relying on the isotopic analysis of tooth dentin, we characterized ontogenetic shifts in diet using quantitative diet modeling techniques in combination with long-term sighting data.  Results indicate that females exhibit individual dietary specialization which likely allows them to forage more efficiently, pass these traits to young via social learning, and reduce overall competition for resources.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The distribution of species across the landscape is of great interest to conservation biology.  Habitat quality and quantity are thought to be important drivers of occurrence and distribution, and numerous studies have demonstrated fitness-related consequences.  However, for species with cryptic or migratory life histories, we often lack sufficient detail about habitat usage and in many cases, general location and activity information are unavailable.  Extrinsic markers, such as tags and bands, have proven to be rather ineffectual due to low returns.  Intrinsic markers, such as stable isotopes, on the hand have great potential because inference is not constrained by recapture.  Rather, important insights regarding movement and habitat use can be derived from both metabolically active and inactive tissues of many wildlife species.  This approach is cost-effective and has led to important findings regarding the location of wintering and breeding grounds, stop over sites, and the concept of migratory connectivity.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings 1. We have generated good evidence that proximal breeding colonies of the Hawaiian petrel exhibit foraging segregation at sea.  This is a novel finding and implies that at-sea biology should be considered in conservation plans.  It also suggests that greater efforts should be directed to better understanding at-sea distributions and activities.2. Long-eared grebes are molt migrants and we took advantage of this situation to estimate site-specific isotopic variance at a primary staging area, Great Salt Lake.  Such estimates are rare in the literature and the variance often assumed to be low.  However, our results suggest that variance can indeed be high and cautions that natural history and a thorough understanding of molt are critical in geographic assignment studies of avian species.3. In a sedentary population of big brown bats, isotopic variance was quite broad, calling into question the utility of stable isotope techniques for the study of migratory bats.  However, through multiple recapture events, we were able to demonstrate that the individuals comprising specific roost populations were indeed dietary specialists, but the population as a whole is comprised of habitat generalists.  These results suggest that individual foraging behavior is invariant through time and that dietary resolving power for habitat generalists, such as many bat species, is coarse.4. Differentiation of dunlin sub-species using stable isotopes results in an approximate 50% miss-classification, which is low, but better than random assignment.  Results are being merged with molecular genetic data and a manuscript is in progress.  5. Exploiting a natural diet shift from marine to terrestrial resources, we were able to derive empirical isotope incorporation rates, which allowed for direct estimation of dunlin arrival dates at the breeding area near Barrow, AK.  We also found our arrival date estimates to better approximate observed data, including snow conditions, compared to those using experimentally derived and allometric-based isotope incorporation rates.6. Redwood forests of northern CA represent important wintering and mating habitat for the silver-haired bat.  However, our spatial resolution using isotope techniques was coarse and limited inference regarding seasonal movements.7. In addition to latitudinal movement by hoary bats, we also uncovered longitudinal migration patterns towards coastal regions during autumn and winter.  Better understanding the movements of this continental migrant will provide context for conserving this cryptic, but important bat species, particularly as it pertains to wind energy development.\n",
      "\t\tAccomplishments Under the auspices of Task 5, Biogeography, the following projects have been completed.  See products for full list of manuscripts and presentations.1.

Several papers have been published on the ecology of the Hawaiian petrel, leading to new insight into the cryptic lifestyle of this endangered species.  In particular, we were able to demonstrate that proximal breeding colonies exhibit foraging segregation at sea, which may have important management and conservation implications.3.

These data will be used to constrain geographic assignment error rates in a companion study of hoary bat mortality at wind farms.4.

Much has been learned about element cycles in a variety of systems using standard geochemical techniques.  However, isotope geochemistry can offer unique and additional insights into sources, processes, and mechanisms.

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings 1. Pothole wetlands are biogeochemical hotspots in the prairie landscape owing principally to dynamic hydroperiod.  The importance of this relates to habitat quantity and quality for migratory waterfowl and other species supported by this unique ecosystem.  Global change may in some cases intensify these hotspots, but the trade-off may be that habitat quantity declines due to negative effects on the water balance of these wetlands.2. Major tropical cyclones have indeed redistributed significant quantities of sediment in Gulf coastal lands of LA.  Preliminary results suggests that some of the sediment likely derives from offshore environs, but uncertainties related to parsing out discrete sediment sources currently precludes quantitative estimates during storm surge events.3. Fire intensity influences the distribution and speciation of soil nutrients and this may have important consequences on stand regeneration and subsequent mitigation efforts.4. The Everglades represents an expansive sub-tropical wetland with a poorly constrained sedimentary history.  On one hand, accretion is thought to be limited because of the sub-tropical setting and consequent influence on mineralization rates.  On the other hand, long-term sea-level rise has resulted in conditions conducive for peat accretion.  We have developed a 14C-based age model using gastropod shells, plant fragments, and charcoal.  Both open system and hard water sources of error were noted and accounted for in the age model.  Carbon accretion rates were shown to be nearly half that for northern peatlands and the rate was relatively static over the last 4000 years suggesting that slow sea-level rise has facilitated peat formation.5. Through a multi-proxy record, we have been able to show that the establishment of the Everglades coincided with a wet climatic period with high Aeolian dust loading, likely sourced from the Sahara.  Following about 2800 cal yr BP, the climatic conditions were drier with marked declines in dustfall, leading to the establishment of sawgrass and tree islands.\n",

      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings 1. Ozark streams are typically clear water, oxic systems with low dissolved organic carbon; all characteristics of aquatic ecosystems with low mercury methylation potential.  However, we observed relatively high mercury concentrations in stream invertebrates and fish.  Results suggest that trophic level is not always an important determinant of biomagnification of mercury, and that the primary vector for mercury bioaccumulation in Ozark streams is via terrestrial organic matter and the detritral pathway.2. Coastal Alaskan gray wolves had significantly higher tissue total mercury burdens compared to wolves in interior Alaska.  This suggests that coastal wolf diets are partially subsidized by marine resources, which is supported by stable isotope data.  Parasite composition and prevalence were similar among coastal and interior wolves.  However, parasites generally had higher total mercury burdens compared to host tissues, suggesting that there may beneficial aspects of parasite infections.3. Methylmercury production, bioaccumulation, and export can be significant in agricultural rice wetlands.  Methylation potential was related to seasonal changes in redox and a number of lines of evidence implicate iron reducing bacteria as having a potentially more important role than sulfate reducing bacteria.4. Mercury levels remain high in harbor seals resident to several California estuaries and stable isotope data indicates exposure is primarily through consumption of marine fishes.  The selenium status of seals from the most mercury contaminated estuaries was low, suggesting that these animals may be deficient.  Additional studies of selenium status are warranted as it may reduce mercury toxicity for harbor seals in contaminated estuaries.5. Insects are globally important in a variety of aquatic and terrestrial food webs, but can also serve as contaminant vectors.  Understanding chemical transformations during metamorphosis is therefore critical to evaluating this contaminant transfer pathway.  Through meta-analysis we found that metals were primarily lost during metamorphosis, whereas most organic contaminants were higher in winged adults, therefore increasing exposure to terrestrial predators.6. In addition to the loss of metal tissue burden during metamorphosis, isotopic fractionation also occurs, which results in tissue enrichment of the winged adult.  This is a novel finding that demonstrates biological fractionation of an essential element and provides insight into the detoxification process.\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle FORT support to GPLCC\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem In FY 2010, Region 2, in cooperation with Region 6, will develop the Great Plains Landscape Conservation Cooperative (GPLCC) to enhance science capacity throughout the Great Plains area.  The geographic area of the GPLCC encompasses parts of eight states: New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming.  Climate models predict increased warming, throughout the LCC area, and for some areas of the geography, greater precipitation. Maximum and minimum temperatures rise in both scenarios. Minimum temperature increases are greatest, indicating increased nighttime warming. Models show both increases and decreases in precipitation over the region and the seasons, although the overall trend is anticipated to be slightly wetter in the Great Plains region. The snow season in the Great Plains is projected to end earlier in the spring, reflecting greater warming in winter and spring. Regional change in climate variability and extreme events may affect various aspects of Great Plains ecosystems. First, changes in winter moisture may impact cool season invasive plants, the extent of sagebrush and other woody perennials on the range, shallow aquifer recharge, streamflow timing, and forage availability and quality. Second, warmer winters may impact the incidence of pest outbreaks, soil organic matter, plant community composition, and the invasion of exotic plants. For example, leafy spurge and Japanese brome may move further south. Third, summer increases in temperature and precipitation may impact the frequency and intensity of hail storms, invasive tree species, and fire management. And last, a change in the frequency and duration of extreme precipitation events can lead to the opposing problems of drought and deluge, as well as early fall and late spring snow storms which can bring problems all their own.The Playa Lakes Joint Venture has agreed to expand its management board and serve as the GPLCC Steering Committee.  A draft action plan outlines six high priority landscapes and a number of priority species of interest.  The LCC steering committee has issued an initial RFP, but will need to meet to determine longer-term applied research and technology applications that will best support the goals and objectives of the GPLCC.Manier's Task, \"Landscape Assessment of Relations among Land Use, Hydrology, and Wildlife Habitats in the Southern Great Plains Region\"---The regional distribution of aquatic, terrestrial, and wetland habitats of the Great Plains Landscape Conservation Cooperative (GPLCC) area have not been previously assessed using a comprehensive, integrated landscape-wide approach, and these data should provide the framework for direct evaluation as well as structure for subsequent investigations of wildlife and habitat within the GPLCC area. Systematic and integrated representation of a diverse set of system drivers and indicators will support identification of important connections, interactions and correlations between climate, hydrologic, geologic, geographic and anthropogenic influences on habitat conditions and wildlife population indicators across the landscape.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Manier's Task, \"Landscape Assessment of Relations among Land Use, Hydrology, and Wildlife Habitats in the Southern Great Plains Region\"---The study plan for the landscape ecology/regional groundwater hydrology study was approved by the GPLCC steering committee in June of 2011.  Initial data collection began in the last quarter of 2011, with the majority of the data collection to be done in FY2012.Data collection primarily entails gathering and managing multivariate, data representing ecological patterns across the region. Significant data management and editing are anticipated for developing integrated datasets and layers and for modeling the distribution of species. Analyses will include spatial summaries as well as spatial and statistical distributions and correlations. A framework for integrated assessment and monitoring of ecosystem condition and functions, population dynamics and habitat suitability will be created. Preliminary assessment will be performed, and information gaps/needs will be identified.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Provide technical and applied research support to the Great Plains LCC through the application of landscape ecology, ecosystem science, climate change science and climate adaptation ecology, wildlife biology, conservation genetics, and habitat/population modeling in aquatic and terrestial systems.Manier's Task, \"Landscape Assessment of Relations among Land Use, Hydrology, and Wildlife Habitats in the Southern Great Plains Region\"a.Complete a comprehensive landscape assessment of the GPLCC area by aggregating, developing and analyzing spatial datasets and developing statistical models to analyze the correlative and functional relations among land use, hydrology, and wildlife habitat.b.Utilize hierarchically organized map and data classes at a watershed scale to provide locally detailed assessments nested within the GPLCC area to provide locally detailed (relevant) information within a landscape perspective. c.Establish a spatial framework and data library required for systematic evaluation of Habitat Suitability, land use and climate effects, population dynamics, surface and groundwater hydrology and for conservation, management and research applications.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan FORT staff will attend the quarterly GPLCC meetings. Additional meetings will be scheduled to determine research and developement needs and workshops scheduled to present results to partners. Products will include publication (refereed journal or USGS Report Series) of the regional assessment, along with numerous formal and informal data and information products, including maps and summary data layers. The precise topics for subsequent work and publications depend on the nature of future research and stakeholder needs and concerns, however similar outlets (namely a combination of reports, journal articles, presentations, conversations, and data exchange). Manier's Task, \"Landscape Assessment of Relations among Land Use, Hydrology, and Wildlife Habitats in the Southern Great Plains Region\"---Communication and coordination is a critical component of USGS support for Landscape Conservation Cooperatives and the Joint Ventures that preceded them because of the history of research, management and cooperation they already provide. Because of the size of the region and diversity of habitats, species and regional priorities, the variety of information and precedent is also large. This project is poised to help synthesize and compile these disparate sources across the region; the utility of this application depends on communication and coordination with the GPLCC staff and steering committee as well as constituents in each state.Benefits and impacts of Work Conducted Under Manier's Task---This information will inform multiple elements of Strategic Habitat Conservation (as implemented by the GPLCC), including species and habitat distribution models, landscape assessment of ownership and conservation estates, risks to habitats and populations, integration of multiple species and habitat elements, inventory, tracking and monitoring programs, and spatial designs and analyses. In addition, understanding and quantifying the hydrologic relations among surface water, groundwater, wetland and upland habitats in the GPLCC will critically inform wetland and aquatic species habitat assessments (including fisheries and waterfowl) and provide important information for effectively utilizing water resources, protecting water quality, predicting the effects of climate change.\n",
      "\t\tHighlightsAndKeyFindings Information generated through this project will inform multiple elements of Strategic Habitat Conservation (as implemented by the GPLCC), including species and habitat distribution models, landscape assessment of ownership and conservation estates, risks to habitats and populations, integration of multiple species and habitat elements, inventory, tracking and monitoring programs, and spatial designs and analyses. In addition, understanding and quantifying the hydrologic relations among surface water, groundwater, wetland and upland habitats in the GPLCC will critically inform wetland and aquatic species habitat assessments (including fisheries and waterfowl) and provide important information for effectively utilizing water resources, protecting water quality, predicting the effects of climate change.Through collaboration with FWS, the Kansas Cooperative Research Unit, and other LCC partners during the data development process, we discovered an important baseline information gap. Therefore, we have developed a collaborative relationship (with colleagues at USGS-EROS) and a prototype process for identifying and classifying (using Landsat data) surface water across the entire region with explicit temporal resolution to support subsequent analyses of habitat and hydrology.  Playa lakes, a critical conservation resource within the GPLCC region, are ephemeral and often episodic wetlands with tremendous importance for migratory and resident waterfowl and shorebirds; but these wetlands are also tremendously variable in space and time making management and habitat conservation challenging. Provided sufficient funding in FY13, we will initiate an effort to fill this information gap about playa lakes.\n",

These lands include nationally important energy resources as well as some of the highest quality wildlife habitat in the intermountain west.  Wyoming sagebrush-steppe is also a stronghold for greater sage-grouse and other sagebrush obligate species.  A critical component of land use planning and decision-making in the state is accurate information on disturbance and reclamation associated with energy and other types of development.  This need exists for specific project areas where development is guided by site-specific requirements and more broadly, across the entire state for monitoring disturbance and assessing the implementation and effectiveness of reclamation efforts.  Similarly, on state and private lands, locations of important habitats as well as knowledge of existing disturbance and reclamation efforts are key to review and approval of applications for different land uses.  Currently there are several data systems in place or under development to address this class of information needs.\n",

For this reason, modelers are constantly searching for ways to find more detailed andmore accurate inputs. In cases where input data sources are unavailable or known to be estimated, modelers must evaluate numerous data sources to find the one, or ensemble, that produce the best model performance.

These priorities are based on State requirements for geologic map information in areas of multiple-issue need or compelling single-issue need and in areas where mapping is required to solve critical Earth science problems.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The Fort Collins Science Center Web Applications Team (FORT) uses an Agile approach to software development and support:All projects operate in two week increments (termed sprints).A development team consists of software developers, support staff, product owners, and a scrum master.The product owners represent project stakeholders, write customer-centric items termed user stories, prioritize them, and add them to the product backlog. Stories can be added to the backlog at any time during the course of the project.This scrum master is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the sprint deliverables and acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. This staff member is also responsible for organizing product testing and project documentation.User stories are selected from backlog at the beginning of a sprint to be worked on during that sprint.During the sprint, the scrum master conducts daily standups and organizes a product owner meeting at the end of each two week sprint.Stand-ups cover what was done the previous day, what tasks are going to be addressed that day, and any blockers that may be encountered. Product owners are invited to call into or attend standups.Product owner meetings have three functions:oThe development staff demonstrates progress made during the sprint;oProduct owners decide which, if any, of the new components will be included in the next release;oThe group collectively selects stories and tasks from the backlog to be addressed in the next sprint (development staff input is required to determine degree of difficulty and estimated time associated with each task).A new release occurs the last day of the sprint.A key principle of this process is the recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need, and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner.\n",

      "\t\tObjectives The Biogeographic Characterization Branch (BCB) desires to pursue both systematic biogeographic characterization research and provide just-in-time answers to science questions about societal challenges. To do this, the Branch needs to bring a bit more cohesion to a somewhat fractionated data service environment. The Branch has already begun building a comprehensive catalog of data, information products, and services needed to conduct our analytical work. This includes developing routes to Branch assets in ScienceBase, as well as cataloging work from other groups important to the mission. In addition, partners can work with a number of analytic toolkits provided by the Branch.However, there is much more that BCB can do to systematize its approach to data deliver and analysis. Many of the functions critical to problem solving rely on too few humans. To ensure that these staff have a better chance of analysis success BCB proposed to develop automated data collection, transform, quality check, analysis, and delivery options. BCB also needs to develop new types of web interfaces, driven from the APIs of the Biogeographic Information System and other partner data services. This map interface would allow users to explore both habitat formers and users across terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems. It should provide access to the full range of Branch products and services, be produced rapidly, and be flexible to incorporate feedback quickly.\n",

Similar ecological impacts are likely on these at-risk islands, if snakes become established.  Effective management of invasive species, such as the Brown Treesnake, require knowledge of the biology and ecology of the species within its introduced and potential ranges. Studies of the vertebrate fauna of Guam in the context of an introduced predator and comparable faunas and habitats on other islands which have not yet been altered by the snake are important to guiding management actions by several federal and local agencies.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology We will employ the best available scientific methods, including advanced quantitative analyses and herpetological techniques, to achieve the objectives, listed in Specific Objectives.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Invasive Species Program Goals # 2 and # 4: 2. Early Detection & Rapid Response - Identify and report new invasions and assess risks to natural areas and waters.4.

Expand biological understanding of the Brown Treesnake, with emphasis on reproduction, recruitment, maturation, movement, and ecology.2. Develop and test tools and strategies for detecting, trapping, and controlling or eradicating the Brown Treesnake, especially for small snakes and low density populations such as incipient populations in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).3. Develop and test tools for detecting and controlling Brown Treesnakes not susceptible to mouse-baited control tools, including juvenile snakes, reproductively active individuals, and/or well-fed individuals.4. Conduct research to understand the ecosystem-level impacts of Brown Treesnake control on Guam, including cascading trophic effects. 5. Conduct research and snake control activities in support of restoration of native vertebrates on Guam.6. Conduct Brown Treesnake early detection and rapid response activities, including training members of the Rapid Response Team, responding to snake sightings on islands other than Guam, and engaging in public outreach and education. 7. Test new snake barrier designs as tools for the protection of endangered species, of the transportation network, and for special situations. Ensure that multi-species barriers retain the ability to exclude Brown Treesnake.\n",

      "\t\tStatementOfProblem Several non-native species of large reptiles are established in the vicinity of Everglades National Park, and some are spread over large areas. The best documented is the Burmese Python (Python molurus bivittatus), of which thousands of specimens have been collected from natural habitats in Florida. An established population of Boa Constrictor (Boa constrictor) was located about 20 km east of the park, in the vicinity of Cutler Bay (Meshaka et al. 2004). A population of Northern African Pythons (Python sebae) is now established in a small area along the suburban fringe of western Miami (Reed et al. 2010), and these snakes have been involved in several human interactions. Several individuals of species including Reticulated Python (Python reticulatus), Green Anaconda (Eunectes murinus), and Yellow Anaconda (Eunectes notaeus) have been collected from habitats in southern Florida over the last decade. A population of Argentine Tegu lizards (Salvator merianae) is established and expanding about 5 km east of the park, and a small population of gold tegus (Tupinambis teguixin sensu lato) is present in the same area. Each of these giant snake and large lizard species has the potential to appreciably alter the natural community in Everglades National Park, in neighoring areas in southern Florida (e.g., Big Cypress National Preserve and Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge), and in areas throughout the southeastern United States (Reed 2005, Reed & Rodda 2009, Reed et al. in prep).\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Our scientists integrate methods from multiple disciplines to improve early detection of, rapid response to, and control of introduced snakes and other reptiles in Florida. This includes methods from wildlife ecology (e.g., camera and live trapping, visual surveys, radio telemetry, diet), anatomy and physiology (e.g., body condition, growth rates, hormonal manipulations, parasitism), behavior (e.g., mating systems), genetics (e.g., DNA barcoding, environmental DNA sampling), and statistical modeling (e.g., predicting species distributions, quantifying detectability).\n",
      "\t\tObjectives Objectives include: (1) Managing research and control activities for invasive reptiles on National Park Service lands in southern Florida, including Burmese Pythons, Argentine Tegus, and other species, with an annual summary provided to agency partners, cooperators, and managers; (2) Consultation with and assistance to land managers from various agencies in Florida who are tasked with addressing the issue of invasive reptiles; (3) Research on, and evaluation of, detection and control methods for invasive reptiles, including ecological research required for effective implementation of these methods; (4) Conducting risk assessments to evaluate the ecological, economic, and human-welfare risks associated with invasive reptiles in the U.S. and other locations. All research for these objectives will be published in peer-reviewed journals and the data will be made publicly available (e.g., on ScienceBase).\n",

      "\t\tTaskTitle Herpetology research and technical assistance, including ecology and invasives control\n",
      "\t\tStatementOfProblem The rate of introductions of exotic reptiles to new habitats worldwide has increased exponentially over the past decade, and many of these introductions have resulted in establishment of invasive populations with potentially severe ecological consequences. Because the number of researchers and managers dedicated to finding solutions for invasive reptiles is very small, many agencies and political entities require assistance to develop plans for combatting the introduction, spread, and impacts of invasive reptiles.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology Our scientists employ research methods, control tool strategy, and herpetological expertise to lead or assist with a range of projects designed to reduce the impacts of invasive reptiles. Methodologies thus span a wide range of topics depending on the habitat and species of interest. We also assist with design and completion of general herpetological studies and educational efforts relating to reptiles, using a similarly wide range of methods and tools.\n",
      "\t\tObjectives As professional herpetologists with extensive invasive reptile experience, a primary objective is to provide technical assistance and research guidance to cooperators, both foreign and domestic. These activities extend beyond the first two tasks above, which deal with specific high-profile reptile invaders. Another major objective is to use our expertise to assist general herpetological research and educational studies and activities, with emphases on species of concern to DOI and engagement of youth audiences in research and educational activities. Resulting products will be better data collection, more efficient management, and improved science communication.\n",
      "\t\tCommunicationPlan Task information will be communicated by:1. Publication of scientific results in peer-reviewed journals or USGS reports.2. Educational efforts aimed at teaching youth about invasive reptiles, reptile ecology, and how reptiles can be used in educational settings.\n",

The methods are new and in development, require specialized experience to implement, and are computationally intensive. Many researchers wishing to apply these methods require consultation and/or collaboration with an experienced practitioner, tailored to their specific interest. There is also a general need for training of researchers, serving as a technical authority for administrators (particularly program leaders), and representing the USGS in interagency initiatives in the field.\n",

Transcriptomics is used to better identify what genes are present in an organism, the conditions under which certain genes are expressed, and how gene expression changes under some condition of interest. Transcriptomics has applications for understanding organismal development and the physiology of disease and stress, as well as identifying 'markers' for when organisms are experiencing a particular condition (such as exposure to a stress) that may not be manifested clinically. Transcriptomics is an emerging field that complements and extends traditional measures of organismal health. However, the data types used in transcriptomics require specialized knowledge in genomics, specialized statistical knowledge, and often must be analyzed with high-performance computers.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The major steps of analysis will include:1. Ensuring that an appropriate sequencing methodology is performed to accomplish the research objective.2. Process raw sequencing data to remove technical artifacts and poor-quality sequence and prepare them for downstream applications.3. Assemble sequence reads into transcript models (the \"transcriptome\") if transcript models are not available for the organism.4. Annotate transcripts by identifying computational signatures of function or nucleotide- or protein-level similarity.5. Identify the relative abundance of transcripts in different samples and apply appropriate statistical methods to identify changes in expression from a reference sample.\n",

These data can provide very sensitive measures of relatedness in order to understand connectivity, dispersal, and evolutionary history of populations, and to identify or prioritize management units. Most contemporary protocols for analyzing large numbers of variants simultaneously are computationally intensive and require an understanding of genetic statistics.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The general workflow to identify \"simple\" or \"single-nucleotide\" polymorphisms (SNPs) suitable for population-genomic analysis is:1. Ensure that an appropriate sequencing methodology is performed to accomplish the research objective.2. Process raw sequencing data to remove technical artifacts and poor-quality sequence and prepare them for downstream applications.3. Create reference sequences by assembling the sequence reads, if necessary. 4. Map sequence reads to the reference sequences to identify variant sites, and retain those sites that segregate in a manner consistent with single-copy genes and the appropriate ploidy.5. Generate genotype predictions for each sample and population-genetic summary statistics such as FST and heterozygosity.\n",

The use of this technology is increasing to understand the dietary requirements and behaviors of organisms that are difficult to determine through observation or traditional diet analysis. Researchers interested in applying barcode genetics in a high-throughput fashion may lack access to the necessary expertise and bioinformatics support.\n",
      "\t\tMethodology The general workflow for barcode sequencing involves:1. Selecting a genetic locus appropriate for the taxonomic group, the desired level of resolution, and the integrity of the recoverable DNA.2. Processing raw sequence data to remove technical artifacts and poor quality sequence. 3. Comparison of recovered sequences against a reference database to identify the relative abundance of the source organisms. Programs that perform these comparisons do not provide an unambiguous assignment but rather a series of scores that must be evaluated in the context of all competing possibilities. Choice of appropriate scoring thresholds depends on knowledge of the underlying algorithms and assumptions.\n",
