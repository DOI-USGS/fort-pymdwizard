Changing the Template
**********************

When **File -> New** is selected, the Metadata Wizard opens a template file and
saves it to a new, user-specified location. This template is an FGDC record that
contains default content which forms a solid starting point for a new record.
For example, the point of contact, distribution contact,
disclaimers. will often remain the same for most records created by
an individual. Having to update these individually every time a new
record is started can be inconvenient. Keep in mind that anything
specified in the template can be overwritten individually when editing a new
record, they are just the defaults that will pre-populate in the application.

The default template record used by the Metadata Wizard is part of the
standard installation but can be changed to suit the particular needs of
individuals or organizations.

#. Open the Metadata Wizard and create a new record, saved to a location where it
   will not be overwritten or inaccessible.
