Launching Jupyter for Batch Processing
********

Some data management or metadata tasks can best be tackled by writing a script
to automate processes that are repetitive or repeated regularly.
Since the Metadata Wizard is built on, and ships with a fairly complete
Python stack, we allow advanced users to leverage this using a Jupyter Notebook.
A live instance of the Jupyter Notebook Kernel can be launch directly from
the Metadata Wizard application by clicking **Launch Jupyter** in the **Advanced** menu.

The default template record used by the Metadata Wizard is part of the
standard installation but can be changed to suit the particular needs of
individuals or organizations.

#. Open the Wizard and create a new record, saved to a location where it
   will not be overwritten or inaccessible.
#. Edit this record in the Wizard to contain the content needed in
   subsequent new records. Sections to consider customizing might
   include some or all of:

   -  Dataset Point of Contact, Metadata Contact, Metadata Standard
      Name, Distribution Information, ISO 19115 Keywords, Place
      Keywords, Bounding Coordinates, Attribute Accuracy Report, Logical
      Accuracy Report, Completeness Report, Positional Accuracy

#. Save this record.
#. In the top menu bar click Advanced->Template->Browse to new template,
   and navigate to the xml file saved above.

The template selected will remain active after closing and reopening the
application. If at any time you want to revert to the original Metadata
Wizard template click the Advanced -> Template -> Restore Built-in item.
The current temple file name will be displayed at the top of the
Advanced -> Template menu,
