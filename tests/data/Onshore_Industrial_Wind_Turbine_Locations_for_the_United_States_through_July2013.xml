      <abstract>This data set provides industrial-scale onshore wind turbine locations in the United States through July 22, 2013, corresponding facility information, and turbine technical specifications. The database has more than 47,000 wind turbine records that have been collected, digitized, locationally verified, and internally quality controlled. Turbines from the Federal Aviation Administration Digital Obstacle File, through product release date July 22, 2013, were used as the primary source of turbine data points. Verification of the turbine positions was done by visual interpretation using high-resolution aerial imagery in ESRI ArcGIS Desktop. Turbines without Federal Aviation Administration Obstacle Repository System numbers were visually identified and point locations were added to the collection. We estimated a locational error of plus or minus 10 meters for turbine locations. Wind farm facility names were identified from publically available facility data sets. Facility names were then used in a web search of additional industry publications and press releases to attribute additional turbine information (such as manufacturer, model, and technical specifications of wind turbines). Wind farm facility location data from various wind and energy industry sources were used to search for and digitize turbines not in existing databases. Technical specifications for turbines were assigned based on the wind turbine make and model as described in literature, specifications listed in the Federal Aviation Administration Digital Obstacle File, and information on the turbine manufacturer’s website. Some facility and turbine information on make and model did not exist or was difficult to obtain. Thus, uncertainty may exist for certain turbine specifications. That uncertainty was rated and a confidence was recorded for both location and attribution data quality.</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this information is to provide a publicly available spatially-referenced, national dataset of onshore industrial wind turbine locations and their technical specifications.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Turbine data points were spatially verified to confirm or edit their correct position. The map scale used while verifying and digitizing turbines depended on location, need, and availability of imagery. Authors used aerial imagery with a typical assessment map scale of 1:2,000 to 1:3,000, then zoomed to a larger map scale of 1:500 to 1:1,000 for point adjustment; none of the spatial verification was done at a map scale smaller than 1:5,000. Turbine locations were initially located and then independently verified and independently verified and checked for Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) by a different team member. The attribute fields were also independently verified and checked for QA/QC by a team member other than the original attribute author. Uncertainty may exist for certain turbine locations as indicated in confidence turbine location (conf_loc). 
A visual comparison of state and county fields were performed against state and county shapefiles. 
The FAA_ORS field was sorted and checked for duplicates. The type_tower field was verified based on a combination of visual identification, turbine spacing, and industry specifications. 
The image_year field was checked for completeness; National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP) (year) was used where authors collected images directly from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/NAIP from Orthorectified County Mosaics; Bing Maps Aerial were usually the most current imagery posted to the source (Bing Maps) and metadata was not recovered for the scenes; Digital Globe's most current imagery from a National Geospatial Intelligence Agency contract under NextView License was used in cases where the most recent imagery was needed and metadata was not recovered for those scenes; USGS EDC Seamless Data Distribution System (SDDS) images were used in early checks of the data, available to the public through the USGS/EROS Data Center, and metadata was not recovered for those images. 
The facility and turbine technical specification attribute fields have been checked for QA/QC and are included in this data. Turbine and facility attributes may have some erroneous information, given the unknown quality of the information sources. Additionally, the reported turbine technical specifications were not field verified nor validated with the source. Confidence in facility and turbine attributes was included in confidence attributes (conf_attr).

    <complete>All states are represented, although some states do not include wind turbines. States that do not have known turbines are: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. 
Potential missing turbines include those not represented in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Digital Obstacle File or not found in our visual aerial image search. Possible causes of unrepresented turbines include low turbine height (less than 200 feet), turbines built previous to the FAA reporting process, or turbines not submitted for review to the FAA. 
Groups of turbines were attributed to a facility by comparing the following attributes across datasets: facility names, turbine counts, proximity to facility locations, and installation dates using temporal imagery or publication dates. When possible, turbines were grouped and attributed to a common wind farm (site_name). In some cases, particularly with older turbines or locations where individual facilities overlapped, it was not possible to attribute individual turbines to distinct facilities. In these cases, a simple naming convention of the general geographic location used within the community of wind energy practitioner, or a county name and a numerical value beginning with 1 was used. For example (unknown County #) (unknown Facility Area #).</complete>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The windmills found in the FAA Digital Obstacle File and other turbines digitized were horizontally verified with aerial imagery and moved, as needed, to a positional accuracy within plus or minus 10 meters to the base of the turbine. NAIP provides 1 meters ground sample distance orthoimagery to within plus or minus 6 meters to true ground at a 95-percent confidence level. SDDS imagery is NAIP orthoimagery stitched together and compressed. The Bing Maps Aerial basemaps have a variable resolution and accuracy based on image source and location. A sample of project wind turbine data points, in various parts of the United States, were checked on Bing Maps Aerial base maps and compared to the NAIP imagery and found to be as accurate as, or better than, NAIP. Our visual interpretation was based on NAIP, Bing, Digital Globe, or SDDS orthoimagery, which all have some registrations errors and internal inaccuracies. Even with those issues, plus an additional 4 meters for human error of digitizing and visual verification, the position of the data points should still fall within plus or minus 10 meters accuracy. If any points are not within plus or minus 10 meters accuracy, it would be caused by errors in the imagery used for verification. Map scale used while verifying and digitizing turbines depended on location, need, and availability of imagery. Authors used aerial imagery with a typical assessment map scale of 1:2,000 to 1:3,000, then zooming to a larger map scale of 1:500 to 1:1,000 for point adjustment; none of the analysis was done at a map scale smaller than 1:5,000.</horizpar>

        <methdesc>Visual interpretation of high resolution aerial orthoimagery was done in Arc Map 10.0 for both verification of known FAA ORS points and digitization of newly located wind turbine locations. Sources for wind turbine facilities and turbine specification attribution were numerous and often found in a web search of industry publications and press releases. The list, on a state basis, is available upon request.

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Prior to steps listed below, turbine locations were mapped using USDA/National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)/NAIP orthoimagery as part of an earlier wind facility land transformation (disturbance) mapping project. Turbine points collected as part of this mapping were identified and mapped across different parts of the United States while searching for wind power facilities. For this data set: 
        1. Wind turbine data was acquired from FAA Digital Obstacle File (DOF); windmills were filtered, and a shapefile of FAA windmills points was created from industry provided coordinates (including FAA fields:FAA_ORS and FAA_AGL). 
        2. Previously digitized turbine locations developed for the disturbance mapping that coincided with FAA points (duplicate locations) were removed, and remaining disturbance mapping points were merged with FAA points as a shapefile. 
        3. Wind farm facility data were acquired from EIA and WENDI and combined with the merged turbine-points data into a single Arc Map 10.0 project. 
        4. Supplemental layers of state and county boundaries, as well as HSIP cultural, landform, hydro points, cities, towns, and villages were added to the ARC Map project to allow for comparisons across data types while matching turbines to facilities. HSIP data were only used internally for data search and attributing and are not part of this final product. 
        5. Turbine points were selected by state, saved as an individual turbine file for each state, and distributed to authors for editing. 
        6. A basemap image of Bing Maps Aerial, or other maps, was added to the Arc Map project file. If Bing Maps Aerial did not show a turbine installation, additional USGS/EROS SDDS orthoimagery from the Eros Data center, USDA/NAIP County Mosaic Orthoimagery, or Digital Globe imagery was added. 
        7. Turbine points were visually verified and edited/moved to the base of the turbine as needed. If the turbine data point was not seen on an image, the conf_loc was entered as 0. If the turbine point was in partial construction or with other doubts, the conf_loc was entered as 1. If clearly seen on image and found the conf_loc was entered as 2. 
        8. A search for unrepresented turbines was done. Searches were performed near known turbines and near facility locations found in the EIA and WENDI data. Any newly identified turbines were digitized. 
        9. State, county, image_name, image_year, and type_tower were attributed for each turbine. 
        10. Groups of turbines were attributed to a facility by comparing the following attributes across datasets: facility names, turbine counts, proximity to facility locations, and installation dates using temporal imagery or publication dates. When possible, turbines were grouped and attributed to a common wind farm (site_name). In some cases, particularly with older turbines or locations where individual facilities overlapped, it was not possible to attribute individual turbines to distinct facilities. In these cases, a simple naming convention of the general geographic location used within the community of wind energy practitioners, or a county name and a numerical scale beginning at 1 was used. For example (unknown County #) (unknown Facility Area #). 
        11. Facility names (site_name) were then used in a web search of additional industry publications and press releases to identify manufacturer, model, and technical specifications of turbines for attributing. If no information was found or major discrepancies were found in the information, a confidence of 0 was entered under the conf_attr field. If some discrepancies were found or some uncertainty existed (usually described in comments), a confidence of 1 was entered. If the identification was clear and easily confirmed, a confidence of 2 was entered. 
        12. QA/QC was conducted for spatial accuracy and attribution by a peer or a supervisor other than the author that initially completed the work.
        13. Edited wind turbine files for each state were merged into one shapefile, and an overview for consistency, correctness, and positional accuracy was performed again by peers and supervisors as a national dataset. 
        14. Non-turbine points that had been assigned FAA Obstacle Repository System (ORS) numbers or were digitized in the process such as communications towers, meteorological towers, water windmills, power transmission towers, etc., were removed.
